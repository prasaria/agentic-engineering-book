# Prioritize Open GitHub Issues

**Template Category**: Structured Data

Analyze and prioritize open GitHub issues using relationship-aware dependency management. This command helps identify the highest-value unblocked work based on dependencies, labels, and strategic alignment.

## Steps

1. **Sync repo state**
   - `git fetch --all --prune`
   - `git pull --rebase` (ensure you have latest issue metadata)

2. **Fetch all open issues**

**Source: GitHub API**
```bash
gh issue list --limit 100 --state open --json number,title,labels,body,createdAt,updatedAt
```

Filter options:
- Filter by assignee: `--assignee @me` or `--assignee <username>`
- Filter by labels: `--label "component:backend"`

3. **Parse relationship metadata**

**Parse Issue Bodies** (GitHub API)
- Review issue bodies for `## Issue Relationships` section (see `.claude/commands/docs/issue-relationships.md`)
- Extract relationship types:
  - **Depends On**: Issues that MUST be completed before work can start (blockers)
  - **Related To**: Issues providing context or sharing technical concerns
  - **Blocks**: Issues waiting on current work to complete
  - **Supersedes**: Issues that replace or deprecate previous work
  - **Child Of**: Issues that are part of larger epics
  - **Follow-Up**: Planned next steps after current work completes
- Check corresponding spec files in `docs/specs/` for additional relationship context
- Use `gh issue view <number>` to inspect individual issues for relationship details

4. **Build dependency graph**

**GitHub API** (manual graph building)
- Identify unblocked issues (no unresolved "Depends On" references)
- Identify high-leverage issues (blocking multiple downstream tasks via "Blocks" relationships)
- Identify isolated issues (no dependencies, safe for parallel execution)
- Check if "Depends On" issues are closed/merged before marking an issue as unblocked

5. **Apply prioritization strategy**
   - **Label-based priority**:
     - `priority:critical` > `priority:high` > `priority:medium` > `priority:low`
   - **Effort-based quick wins**:
     - Prefer `effort:small` for quick wins when priority is equal
     - Balance high-priority large efforts with small quick wins
   - **Strategic alignment**:
     - Issues with `Child Of` relationships to active epics
     - Issues referenced in recent project discussions or OKRs
   - **Unblocked status**:
     - ONLY recommend issues with no unresolved dependencies
     - Verify "Depends On" issues are closed before recommending

6. **Generate prioritization report**
   - List top 5-10 highest-priority unblocked issues
   - For each issue, include:
     - Issue number and title
     - Priority, effort, and component labels
     - Dependency status (unblocked, blocked by #X, blocks #Y)
     - Strategic context (epic membership, related work)
     - Recommended action (start immediately, wait for dependencies, needs investigation)
   - Separate sections for:
     - **Ready to Start**: Unblocked issues sorted by priority/effort
     - **Blocked**: Issues waiting on dependencies (with blocker details)
     - **High-Leverage**: Issues blocking multiple downstream tasks

7. **Validate recommendations**
   - For each recommended issue, verify:
     - All "Depends On" issues are closed/merged
     - Labels are complete (component, priority, effort, status)
     - Issue is not already assigned (unless filtering by assignee)
   - If issues are missing metadata, note them for cleanup in report

## Reporting

Provide a structured prioritization report with:
- **Executive Summary**: Top 3 recommended issues with rationale
- **Ready to Start**: Full list of unblocked issues (sorted by priority/effort)
- **Blocked**: Issues waiting on dependencies (with estimated unblock timeline)
- **High-Leverage**: Issues that would unblock the most downstream work
- **Metadata Issues**: Issues missing labels or relationship documentation
- **Dependency Visualization**: Simple text-based graph showing issue relationships

## Output Schema

This command's output is validated against the following schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "ready_to_start": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "number": { "type": "number" },
          "title": { "type": "string" },
          "priority": { "type": "string" },
          "effort": { "type": "string" },
          "component": { "type": "string" },
          "rationale": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["number", "title", "priority", "effort", "rationale"]
      }
    },
    "blocked": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "number": { "type": "number" },
          "title": { "type": "string" },
          "blocked_by": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "type": "number" }
          }
        },
        "required": ["number", "title", "blocked_by"]
      }
    },
    "high_leverage": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "number": { "type": "number" },
          "title": { "type": "string" },
          "blocks_count": { "type": "number" }
        },
        "required": ["number", "title", "blocks_count"]
      }
    },
    "summary": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["ready_to_start", "summary"]
}
```

The output should be a JSON object containing arrays of ready-to-start, blocked, and high-leverage issues, along with a summary of recommendations.

## Examples

### Example: High-priority unblocked feature
Issue #145 (feat: add MCP server foundation):
- Priority: high, Effort: medium, Component: backend
- Depends On: #25 (closed), #26 (closed)
- Blocks: #148, #150
- Rationale: Unblocked after API key and rate limiting merged. Unblocks 2 downstream features.

### Example: Blocked issue
Issue #110 (feat: multi-agent framework Phase 1):
- Priority: high, Effort: large, Component: automation
- Depends On: #105 (open), #108 (open)
- Rationale: Blocked until log analysis and state management are merged.

### Example: Quick win
Issue #52 (chore: add migration validation script):
- Priority: medium, Effort: small, Component: ci-cd
- Depends On: None
- Rationale: Low effort, isolated work, improves CI reliability. Good quick win.
