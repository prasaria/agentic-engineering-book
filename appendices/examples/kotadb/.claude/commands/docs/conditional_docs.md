# Conditional Documentation Guide

**Template Category**: Message-Only
**Prompt Level**: 1 (Static)

Use this reference to decide which KotaDB documentation sources to consult before you start working. Read only the docs whose conditions match your task so you stay efficient.

## Instructions
- Understand the request or issue scope first.
- Scan the Conditional Documentation list below; when a condition applies, open that doc and incorporate the guidance before proceeding.
- Prioritise the most specific documents (specs/vision) after you’ve covered the foundational repos docs.
- Skip docs that are clearly unrelated—avoid over-reading.
