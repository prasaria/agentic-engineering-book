# Conditional Documentation Guide - Automation Layer

**Template Category**: Message-Only
**Prompt Level**: 1 (Static)

Use this reference to decide which KotaDB automation layer documentation sources to consult before you start working on ADW workflows, agent orchestration, worktree isolation, or log analysis. Read only the docs whose conditions match your task so you stay efficient.

## Instructions
- Understand the request or issue scope first.
- Scan the Conditional Documentation list below; when a condition applies, open that doc and incorporate the guidance before proceeding.
- Prioritise the most specific documents (specs/vision) after you've covered the foundational repos docs.
- Skip docs that are clearly unrelated—avoid over-reading.
