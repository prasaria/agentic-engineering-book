# Conditional Documentation Guide - Web Layer

**Template Category**: Message-Only
**Prompt Level**: 1 (Static)

Use this reference to decide which KotaDB web frontend documentation sources to consult before you start working on UI components, client-side logic, or web application features. Read only the docs whose conditions match your task so you stay efficient.

## Instructions
- Understand the request or issue scope first.
- Scan the Conditional Documentation list below; when a condition applies, open that doc and incorporate the guidance before proceeding.
- Prioritise the most specific documents (specs/vision) after you've covered the foundational repos docs.
- Skip docs that are clearly unrelated—avoid over-reading.

## Conditional Documentation

## Adding Web Documentation

When adding web layer documentation:
1. Follow the pattern established in `app.md` and `automation.md`
2. Include clear conditions that specify when to consult each document
3. Prioritize specificity (when to read) over comprehensiveness (all possible uses)
4. Group related documentation logically (architecture, testing, deployment, etc.)
