# CC Hook Expert - Improve

**Template Category**: Action
**Prompt Level**: 6 (Self-Modifying)

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Recent Changes

```bash
git log --oneline -30 --all -- ".claude/hooks/**" ".claude/settings.json" ".claude/settings*.json"
```

Review recent commits affecting Claude Code hooks and configuration.

### 2. Extract Learnings

**Identify Successful Patterns:**
- Review merged PRs for new hook implementations
- Note configuration patterns that worked well
- Document error handling improvements

**Pattern Categories to Track:**
- Hook trigger patterns
- Timeout configurations
- Error recovery strategies
- JSON I/O patterns
- Matcher syntax patterns

### 3. Update Expertise Sections

Edit the following files to incorporate learnings:
- `cc_hook_expert_plan.md` → Update "Claude Code Hook Knowledge Areas"
- `cc_hook_expert_review.md` → Update "Review Focus Areas"

**Rules for Updates:**
- **PRESERVE** existing patterns unless confirmed obsolete
- **APPEND** new learnings with evidence from commit history
- **DATE** new entries with commit reference (e.g., "Added after #123")
- **REMOVE** only patterns contradicted by multiple recent implementations

### 4. Document Anti-Patterns

**Sources for Anti-Patterns:**
- PRs with requested changes for hook issues
- CI failures related to hook timeouts
- Runtime errors from hook execution

**Format for New Anti-Patterns:**
```
- [Anti-pattern description] (discovered in #PR_NUMBER)
  - Why it failed: [explanation]
  - Better alternative: [recommendation]
```

### 5. Validate Updates

After updating expertise sections:
1. Review changes for consistency
2. Ensure no contradictions with existing patterns
3. Verify hook examples still function correctly

## Output

Return summary of changes made to Expertise sections:

**Patterns Added:**
- [New pattern with source reference]

**Patterns Updated:**
- [Existing pattern refined, reason for update]

**Anti-Patterns Documented:**
- [New anti-pattern with evidence]
