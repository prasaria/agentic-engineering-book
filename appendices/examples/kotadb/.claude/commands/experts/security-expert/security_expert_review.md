# Security Expert - Review

**Template Category**: Structured Data
**Prompt Level**: 5 (Higher Order)

## Variables

REVIEW_CONTEXT: $ARGUMENTS

## Expertise

### Review Focus Areas

**Critical Issues (automatic CHANGES_REQUESTED):**
- New tables without RLS policies
- Missing UPDATE/DELETE policies on existing tables (found in #271)
- SQL string interpolation (injection risk)
- Hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Auth middleware bypass for authenticated endpoints
- Service role client used where anon should be used
- Missing rate limit enforcement on new endpoints
- bcrypt work factor below 10
- Sensitive data in error responses
- Missing revoked_at check in key validation (found in #385)

**Important Concerns (COMMENT level):**
- Missing input validation on user-supplied data
- Overly permissive RLS policies
- Error messages that leak implementation details
- Missing audit logging for sensitive operations
- Insecure default configurations

### Security Checklist

**Authentication:**
- [ ] All authenticated endpoints use auth middleware
- [ ] API key validation before any database access
- [ ] JWT token validation for OAuth users (commit 3c09d9b)
- [ ] Token format routing (kota_* vs JWT) implemented correctly
- [ ] Rate limit headers set on all responses
- [ ] Auth context properly isolated per request
- [ ] Revoked keys rejected via revoked_at check (#385)

**Authorization:**
- [ ] RLS policies cover all CRUD operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] UPDATE policies present on job/status tables (#271)
- [ ] Multi-table RLS for workspace associations (#431)
- [ ] Service role usage justified and documented
- [ ] Organization-scoped data properly isolated
- [ ] Tier-based feature access enforced

**Data Protection:**
- [ ] No secrets in code or logs
- [ ] Sensitive data not exposed in errors
- [ ] Sensitive data redacted from Sentry reports (commit ed4c4f9)
- [ ] bcrypt used for password/key hashing
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs (commit ed4c4f9)

**Input Handling:**
- [ ] All user input validated
- [ ] Parameterized queries used
- [ ] File paths sanitized
- [ ] JSON schema validation on request bodies
- [ ] SQL reserved keywords quoted (commit b1f0074)
- [ ] ON CONFLICT for idempotent operations (commit c499925)

### Vulnerability Patterns Discovered

**Missing RLS UPDATE Policy (discovered in #271):**
- Attack vector: Authenticated users could read but not update job status
- Impact: "Job not found or access denied" errors, broken functionality
- Remediation: Add explicit UPDATE policy for user_id scoped access
- Prevention: Always create policies for ALL CRUD operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

**API Key Revocation Bypass (discovered in #385):**
- Attack vector: Revoked keys could still authenticate if revoked_at not checked
- Impact: Compromised keys remain valid after revocation attempt
- Remediation: Check `revoked_at IS NULL` in validator before bcrypt comparison
- Prevention: Soft delete columns must be checked in all access paths

**Duplicate Key Constraint Violations (discovered in #271):**
- Attack vector: Inconsistent JSON stringification in deduplication logic
- Impact: Constraint violations during batch processing
- Remediation: Use ON CONFLICT in SQL for idempotent inserts
- Prevention: Always use ON CONFLICT for batch operations (commit c499925)

**Reserved Keyword SQL Errors (discovered in commit b1f0074):**
- Attack vector: Unquoted 'references' keyword in function definitions
- Impact: Migration failures, production deployment blocked
- Remediation: Quote all reserved keywords in SQL
- Prevention: Review SQL against PostgreSQL reserved keyword list

### Severity Ratings

**CRITICAL (immediate fix required):**
- Authentication bypass
- SQL injection vulnerability
- Exposed secrets
- RLS disabled on sensitive table

**HIGH (fix before merge):**
- Missing RLS policy (any CRUD operation)
- Incomplete RLS coverage (missing UPDATE/DELETE - see #271)
- Weak input validation
- Service role misuse
- Rate limit bypass (check both hourly and daily limits - #423)

**MEDIUM (fix in follow-up):**
- Overly verbose error messages
- Missing audit logging
- Suboptimal bcrypt rounds

**LOW (nice to have):**
- Security header improvements
- Additional input sanitization
- Enhanced logging

## Workflow

1. **Parse Diff**: Identify security-relevant changes in REVIEW_CONTEXT
2. **Check Critical**: Scan for automatic CHANGES_REQUESTED triggers
3. **Run Checklist**: Apply security checklist to changes
4. **Assess Severity**: Rate identified issues
5. **Synthesize**: Produce security assessment
