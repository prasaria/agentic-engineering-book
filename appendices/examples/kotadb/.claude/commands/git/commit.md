# /commit

**Template Category**: Message-Only

Generate a git commit message for the staged work.

## Variables
- agent_name: $1 (planner or implementor)
- issue_type: $2 (feature, bug, chore)
- issue_json: $3 (GitHub issue payload)

## Instructions
- Commit message format: `<issue_type>: ${issue_number} - <short description>`.
- Description must be ≤ 60 characters, present tense, no trailing period.
- Preface the body (if needed) with `Generated with ADW ID: <adw_id>` is handled elsewhere—only craft the subject.
- Review `git diff HEAD` to understand staged changes before generating the message.
- **DO NOT execute git commands** (staging/committing is handled by the orchestration layer).

## CRITICAL: Commit Message Validation Rules

Your commit message will be validated by `automation/adws/adw_modules/validation.py`. It MUST pass these checks:

### Format Requirements
- **Conventional Commits format**: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- **Valid types**: feat, fix, chore, docs, test, refactor, perf, ci, build, style
- **Subject length**: 1-72 characters (keep under 60 for best practices)
- **Optional scope**: You can add a scope in parentheses after the type (e.g., `feat(api):`)

### Meta-Commentary Patterns (FORBIDDEN in first line)

**DO NOT include these phrases anywhere in the commit message subject line:**
- ❌ `based on`
- ❌ `the commit should`
- ❌ `here is`
- ❌ `this commit`
- ❌ `i can see`
- ❌ `looking at`
- ❌ `the changes`
- ❌ `let me`

These patterns indicate agent reasoning leakage. The commit message should be a direct statement, not a description of your thought process.

## Examples

**✅ CORRECT (these will pass validation):**
```
chore: 98 - document test path resolution strategy
feat: 123 - add rate limiting middleware
fix: 456 - resolve API key validation bug
docs: 789 - update authentication guide
```

**❌ INCORRECT (these will FAIL validation):**
```
Based on the changes, I can see this is a documentation update
The commit should be: chore - update docs
Here is the commit message for the changes
This commit documents the test path resolution strategy
Looking at the diff, the changes add rate limiting
```

**Why the incorrect examples fail:**
- They contain meta-commentary patterns in the first line
- They explain what the commit is rather than stating what it does
- They sound like agent reasoning instead of a commit message

## Run
1. `git diff HEAD` (for context only, to understand the changes)

## Report

**OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL):**

Your response will be used DIRECTLY as the commit message without any parsing or extraction. You MUST output EXACTLY one line containing ONLY the commit message in the format:

```
<type>: <issue_number> - <description>
```

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **First character** of your response must be a valid type (`chore`, `feat`, `fix`, etc.)
2. **No preamble** - do not write ANYTHING before the commit message
3. **No postamble** - do not write ANYTHING after the commit message
4. **No explanation** - your ENTIRE response is the commit message itself
5. **Single line only** - no line breaks, no additional sentences

**DO NOT include:**
- ❌ "Based on the git status..." or "Based on the staged work..."
- ❌ "The commit message is:" or "Here's the commit message:"
- ❌ "I can see that..." or "Looking at the changes..."
- ❌ "Since this is a..." or any contextual explanation
- ❌ Markdown formatting (no **bold**, no ` ``` blocks`)
- ❌ Multiple lines or additional commentary
- ❌ ANY text before or after the commit message

**✅ CORRECT output (this is your ENTIRE response):**
```
chore: 98 - document test path resolution strategy
```

**❌ INCORRECT output (do NOT do this):**
```
Based on the changes, the commit message should be:

chore: 98 - document test path resolution strategy
```

**❌ ALSO INCORRECT (do NOT do this):**
```
Based on the staged work (plan specification file for issue #86), here's the commit message:

chore: 86 - validate and document git staging fix
```

**Remember**: Your response IS the commit message. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Output Schema

This command's output is validated against the following schema:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "pattern": "^(feat|fix|chore|docs|test|refactor|perf|ci|build|style)(\\([^)]+\\))?: [0-9]+ - .{1,50}"
}
```

The output must be a single-line commit message following Conventional Commits format with an issue number and description of 1-50 characters.
