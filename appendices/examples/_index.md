# Examples

Concrete examples from real projects—prompts that worked, configurations worth reusing, and patterns that emerged in practice.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a reference library for:
- **Prompts** - System prompts, task prompts, and instruction patterns that proved effective
- **Configurations** - Tool configs, agent setups, MCP server definitions
- **Patterns in action** - How the patterns in `/patterns` look when applied to real problems

## Organization

Examples organized by project:
- `context-loading-demo/` - Basic context management and tool use patterns
- `kotadb/` - KotaDB database project examples (Level 2-3 patterns)
- `orchestrator/` - Orchestration pattern examples
- `gastown/` - [Gas Town: Multi-Agent Workspace Manager](gastown/_index.md) case study

## Using These Examples

Examples here are meant to be adapted, not copied verbatim. When referencing:
1. Note what context made this example effective
2. Identify which parts are project-specific vs. generalizable
3. Link back to the relevant pattern or foundation entry

## Questions to Answer Here

- What makes an example worth preserving vs. just discarding after use?
- How do you balance specificity (useful detail) with generalizability (applicable elsewhere)?
- Should examples include failures/anti-patterns alongside successes?
