## Style Guidelines

See [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md) for complete requirements. Key points:

**Voice:**
- Third-person technical writing
- Evidence-grounded claims
- No marketing language or hype
- Specifics over generalities

**Structure:**
- Problem statement
- Solution description
- Implementation patterns
- Trade-offs and constraints
- Evidence from production

**Examples:**
- Real code, not pseudocode
- Complete enough to understand
- Annotated with context
- Include failure modes

## Frontmatter Requirements

All content files must include proper frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Entry Title
description: Brief description of the content
created: 2025-01-21
last_updated: 2025-01-21
tags: [relevant, tags]
contributor: Your Name (Optional - for community contributions)
part: 1                    # Part number (if applicable)
part_title: Foundations    # Part name (if applicable)
chapter: 2                 # Chapter number (if applicable)
section: 1                 # Section number (if applicable)
order: 1.2.1              # Sort key (if applicable)
---
```

### Contributor Field

The optional `contributor` field allows attribution:
```yaml
contributor: Jane Smith
contributor: Jane Smith (Company Name)
contributor: Jane Smith - Skool @username
```

Maintainers will verify Skool membership before merging contributions with attribution.

## Content Placement

### New Patterns or Practices
- Add to existing chapter sections when possible
- Propose new sections in Chapter 6 (Patterns) or Chapter 7 (Practices)
- Include in PR description why new section is needed

### Examples
- Add to `appendices/examples/` if substantial
- Include inline if illustrating a specific point
- Follow existing example structure

### Corrections
- Edit existing files directly
- Update `last_updated` in frontmatter
- Note correction in PR description

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and professional
- Assume good intent
- Focus on technical merit
- No self-promotion or marketing
- No plagiarism - cite sources
- Respect confidential/proprietary information

## Questions?

- Ask in the Skool community first
- Open a GitHub Discussion for clarification
- Tag maintainers in your PR if urgent
