# Mental Models

Mental models are frameworks for thinking about agentic systems. They're evaluated by utility rather than correctness—a model is valuable when it enables better design decisions, not because it's "true" in some absolute sense.

## Mental Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Pit of Success](1-pit-of-success.md) | Design systems where the easiest path is also the correct path |
| [Prompt Maturity Model](2-prompt-maturity-model.md) | Seven levels of prompt sophistication from static to meta-cognitive |
| [Specs as Source Code](3-specs-as-source-code.md) | Specifications are the primary programming surface in agentic systems |
| [Context as Code](4-context-as-code.md) | Treat agent knowledge like software, not documents |
| [Execution Topologies](5-execution-topologies.md) | A measurement framework for understanding and improving agent execution structures |

## Connections

- **To [Foundations](../1-foundations/_index.md):** The four pillars framework (prompts, models, context, tools) is itself a mental model for decomposing agentic systems
- **To [Patterns](../6-patterns/_index.md):** Patterns are mental models made concrete through implementation—abstract frameworks translated into specific architectural decisions
