# Multi-Agent Context

How context management changes in multi-agent systems: isolation patterns that prevent pollution, and the critical distinction between ephemeral context and persistent state.

---

## Multi-Agent Context Isolation

*[2025-12-09]*: In multi-agent systems, context isolation is a deliberate architectural choice that fundamentally differs from single-agent context management.

**The Pattern**: Each subagent maintains its own separate context window. Rather than sharing a massive context, subagents work in isolation and return only synthesized, relevant information to the orchestrator. The orchestrator's context stays clean because it receives summaries and conclusions, not raw data.

### Why It Works

- Prevents context pollution—one agent's research doesn't bloat another's working memory
- Enables true parallelism—agents can process information simultaneously without stepping on each other
- Natural compression—synthesis happens at the boundary, not as a cleanup step
- Predictable quality—each agent starts fresh with focused context

### The Trade-off

This approach uses significantly more tokens—research shows ~15× more than single-agent approaches for complex multi-tool tasks. However, token usage explains 80% of performance variance in multi-agent systems. The architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed (both single and multi-agent achieve similar ~40s latency for complex tasks).

*[2025-12-10]*: The 15× token multiplier and 80% variance explanation come from analysis of multi-agent orchestration for decision support tasks. See [Sources](#sources) for the multi-agent orchestration research paper.

### When to Use

Multi-agent context isolation excels in specific scenarios:
- **Complex tasks** benefiting from parallel analysis by specialized experts
- **High-reliability requirements** where near-zero quality variance matters
- **Research synthesis** where multiple sources need independent analysis
- **Decision support** requiring deterministic, reproducible outputs

For simple tasks, multi-agent context isolation introduces unnecessary overhead.

### Agent Teams vs Subagents

*[2026-02-05]*: Context isolation differs significantly between subagents and agent teams (TeammateTool), reflecting different coordination models.

**Subagents (Traditional Pattern):**
- Isolated context windows (no parent conversation history)
- Return summaries to orchestrator
- No inter-subagent communication (coordination via orchestrator)
- Coordination state flows through spec files or orchestrator context
- Pattern: Hub-and-spoke architecture

**Agent Teams (Experimental):**
- Isolated context windows (independent sessions for each teammate)
- Peer-to-peer messaging without orchestrator mediation
- Shared task list and message queue (observable at `~/.claude/teams/<team_id>/`)
- Automatic message delivery when teammates check for updates
- Pattern: Peer coordination with optional orchestrator oversight

**Key Distinction:** Subagents isolate context to prevent pollution and enable parallelism. Agent teams isolate context while adding direct communication channels—teammates coordinate through messages, not through shared context.

**When Context Isolation Matters:**
- **Subagents**: Prevents orchestrator context pollution from worker search/analysis operations
- **Agent teams**: Prevents peer context pollution while enabling coordination messages

Both patterns achieve context hygiene, but agent teams add collaboration primitives that subagents lack.

**See:** [Agent Teams documentation](../../9-practitioner-toolkit/1-claude-code.md#agent-teams-native-multi-agent-coordination-experimental) for coordination patterns, message primitives, and decision frameworks. [Official Claude Code docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/agent-teams) for setup and usage.

### Contrast with Single-Agent

Single-agent approaches accumulate everything in one context window. Context compounds over time, eventually degrading capability. Multi-agent systems isolate by design—each agent maintains focused context for its specialized role. The orchestrator aggregates final outputs, not intermediate states, keeping its own context clean.

### Sub-Agent Forking

*[2026-01-11]*: Claude Code 2.1.0 introduced explicit sub-agent forking via `context: fork` in agent, skill, or slash command frontmatter. This provides a declarative mechanism for context isolation without relying on the implicit isolation of Task tool spawning.

**Syntax:**

```yaml
---
name: isolated-researcher
description: Research task with fresh context
context: fork
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch
---

[Agent instructions...]
```

**When `context: fork` activates:**
- The sub-agent starts with a fresh context window
- No conversation history from the parent carries over
- Results return to the parent as a synthesized summary
- Parent context remains unmodified by sub-agent operations

**Use Cases:**

| Scenario | Benefit of Forking |
|----------|-------------------|
| Research tasks | Fresh context prevents existing knowledge from biasing investigation |
| Skill testing | Test skill behavior without polluting main conversation |
| Parallel analysis | Multiple forks analyze independently, results aggregate cleanly |
| Sensitive operations | Isolate potentially context-polluting operations |

**Contrast with Implicit Isolation:**

The Task tool already provides context isolation—subagents maintain separate context windows. `context: fork` makes this explicit at the definition level:

| Approach | Isolation Timing | Declaration |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Task tool | At spawn time | Implicit in Task invocation |
| `context: fork` | At definition time | Explicit in frontmatter |

**When to Use:**

- **Prefer `context: fork`** when isolation is inherent to the agent's purpose (e.g., "always start fresh for this type of task")
- **Prefer Task tool defaults** when isolation depends on invocation context (e.g., "sometimes share context, sometimes isolate")

## Persistent State vs. Ephemeral Context

*[2025-12-09]*: Context is ephemeral—it lives in the active window and dies with the session. State is persistent—it survives across sessions, agents, and even application restarts. The distinction matters for production systems.

### The Confusion

Most discussions conflate context and state. "Give the agent more context" often means "persist information across sessions." But these are fundamentally different:

| Aspect | Ephemeral Context | Persistent State |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Lifetime** | Single session/conversation | Survives restarts |
| **Scope** | One agent's working memory | Shared across agents/sessions |
| **Cost** | Tokens in context window | Storage + retrieval |
| **Failure Mode** | Context rot, capacity limits | Stale data, sync issues |

### What Belongs Where

- **Context**: Current task details, recent tool outputs, working hypotheses, intermediate reasoning
- **State**: User preferences, conversation history, accumulated knowledge, learned corrections, cross-session continuity

Trying to reconstruct state from context each session is expensive and error-prone. Trying to persist everything as state creates sync nightmares.

### Google ADK's State Prefixes

ADK demonstrates elegant scoping with prefixes that determine persistence lifetime:

| Prefix | Lifetime | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `session:` | Current conversation | Working memory, intermediate results |
| `user:` | Across sessions for this user | Preferences, accumulated knowledge |
| `app:` | Application-wide | Shared configuration, global state |
| `temp:` | Single turn | Scratch space, discardable |

The elegance: namespace by lifecycle, not by feature. No configuration overhead—the prefix declares intent.

### Example: State Prefix Usage

```python
# Google ADK state management example

# Session-scoped: Current task context
await state.set("session:current_file", "auth.py")
await state.set("session:last_edit", "line 42")

# User-scoped: Preferences across sessions
await state.set("user:preferred_style", "functional")
await state.set("user:editor_config", {"indent": 2})

# App-scoped: Shared configuration
await state.set("app:api_endpoint", "https://api.example.com")
await state.set("app:rate_limit", 100)

# Temp-scoped: Discardable scratch data
await state.set("temp:calculation_result", 3.14159)
await state.set("temp:search_buffer", ["result1", "result2"])
```

The prefix determines persistence behavior without additional configuration. When the session ends, `session:*` and `temp:*` keys disappear. `user:*` and `app:*` persist for future sessions.

### Practical Implications

1. **Multi-session workflows** need persistent state, not reconstructed context
2. **User preferences** belong in state, not re-injected each session
3. **Conversation continuity** requires state—context windows aren't infinite
4. **Knowledge accumulation** (learned corrections, discovered patterns) must persist

### The Missing Piece in Claude Code

Claude Code's context management is sophisticated for ephemeral context (progressive disclosure, multi-agent isolation) but lacks native persistent state beyond conversation history. For cross-session state, you need external storage—databases, files, or services like VertexAI's session management.

This is a real gap. When an agent learns something valuable mid-session, how does that learning persist? Currently: it doesn't, unless you build external persistence.
