# IDE Integrations

AI coding assistance has moved from novelty to necessity. Every major IDE now ships with or supports AI integration. The question is no longer "should agents assist with coding?" but "which integration approach fits the workflow?"

---

## The Integration Spectrum

*[2026-01-30]*: IDE AI integrations fall along a spectrum from lightweight extensions to purpose-built editors.

### Extension-Based

Extensions add AI capabilities to existing editors without changing the core experience. Examples: GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Continue.dev, JetBrains AI Assistant.

**Advantages:**
- Preserves existing keybindings, settings, and muscle memory
- Mix-and-match: combine multiple extensions
- Lower switching cost

**Trade-offs:**
- AI features constrained by extension API limits
- Context awareness limited to what the extension can access
- Less tight integration with editor internals

### Fork-Based

Forks of existing editors (typically VS Code) rebuilt around AI. Examples: Cursor, Windsurf.

**Advantages:**
- Deeper integration possible than extensions allow
- AI-first UX decisions throughout
- Can modify core editor behavior for AI workflows

**Trade-offs:**
- Lags behind upstream editor updates
- May break with some extensions
- Vendor lock-in to the fork

### Native AI Editors

Purpose-built from the ground up for AI coding. Examples emerging in 2026, though most current "AI editors" are forks.

## Tool Comparison

| Tool | Type | Model Options | Multi-File Edit | Agent Mode | Self-Hosted | Cost |
|------|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|------|
| **Cursor** | Fork (VS Code) | Claude, GPT, Gemini, custom | Yes | Yes | No | $20/mo |
| **Windsurf** | Fork (VS Code) | Multiple via Cascade | Yes | Yes | Enterprise | $15/mo |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Extension | GPT, Claude (via agent) | Yes | Yes (preview) | No | $19/mo |
| **Continue.dev** | Extension | Any (local, API, cloud) | Yes | Limited | Yes | Free (OSS) |
| **JetBrains AI** | Extension | Multiple + BYOK | Yes | Yes (Junie) | Local LLM | $10/mo |
| **Aider** | CLI | Any (local or API) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Free (OSS) |

## Cursor

*[2026-01-30]*: Cursor has emerged as the industry standard for agentic coding, particularly since its 2.0 release with the Composer model.

### Defining Characteristics

**Speed:** Cursor's proprietary Composer model operates at roughly 2x the speed of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, making iteration feel "instant enough" that practitioners no longer hesitate to rerun plans or experiments.

**Tab Completion Evolution:** The Tab model has moved beyond line completion to predicting cursor position and entire diff blocks. It proposes modifications before typing begins—a qualitative shift from autocomplete to "edit anticipation."

**Multi-File Awareness:** Unlike chat interfaces that operate file-by-file, Cursor applies edits across dozens of files in a single iteration while maintaining code consistency. Refactoring services becomes a single prompt rather than tedious file-hopping.

### Agentic Workflow

In agent mode, Cursor:
- Executes terminal commands (install dependencies, run tests)
- Analyzes compilation errors
- Proposes fixes without human intervention
- Iterates until the task completes or requires escalation

The workspace concept is critical: Cursor operates within a sandboxed area with full access. When workspace boundaries become an issue, the model doesn't always clearly indicate this—verify what the agent can access when uncertain.

### Context Management

Symbols like `@Codebase`, `@Docs`, and `@Git` grant the model access to the project's dependency graph. This repository-scale comprehension minimizes hallucinations when referencing functions across modules.

### Enterprise Considerations

Privacy Mode (SOC 2 compliant) ensures code is never stored or used for training. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Cursor—enterprise adoption is significant.

---

## Windsurf (Cascade)

*[2026-01-30]*: Windsurf (formerly Codeium) positions itself as a full-stack AI development environment rather than an editor layer.

### Cascade Architecture

Cascade combines three capabilities:
1. **Deep codebase understanding** - Repository-scale comprehension
2. **Tool breadth** - MCP integrations with GitHub, Slack, Stripe, Figma, databases
3. **Real-time awareness** - Tracks edits, commands, clipboard, and terminal activity

The system infers intent from observed actions, adapting without requiring explicit instructions repeated across turns.

### Autonomous Memories

Cascade generates memories automatically to persist context between conversations. This addresses a common pain point: reestablishing context after closing the editor.

### Turbo Mode

Allows Cascade to run terminal commands autonomously. For practitioners comfortable with agent autonomy, this eliminates the approval friction that slows many agentic workflows.

### Live Preview

Visual feedback loop: see website changes live in the IDE, click elements, and let Cascade reshape them. Useful for frontend iteration where visual feedback matters more than code review.

### Pricing Structure

Credit-based: Free (25/mo), Pro $15/mo (500), Teams $30/user/mo, Enterprise $60/user/mo with zero data retention defaults.

---

## GitHub Copilot

*[2026-01-30]*: GitHub Copilot continues evolving from autocomplete to full agentic capabilities.

### Agent Mode (2025-2026)

Agent mode enables Copilot to:
- Determine which files require changes
- Offer code changes and terminal commands
- Iterate to remediate issues until the task completes

Unlike traditional chat, Agent Mode translates ideas into code by identifying necessary subtasks and executing them across files.

### Copilot Coding Agent

The most autonomous Copilot capability: assign a GitHub issue to Copilot and it works in an ephemeral development environment (powered by GitHub Actions), creates changes, runs tests and linters, and produces a pull request for review.

This represents a shift from "assistant in the editor" to "autonomous contributor"—Copilot operates like a human developer with its own CI environment.

### Copilot CLI (January 2026)

Specialized agents for common tasks:
- **Explore** - Fast codebase analysis without cluttering main context
- **Task** - Runs commands like tests and builds

Copilot delegates automatically and can run multiple agents in parallel.

### Model Flexibility

Copilot now supports multiple models beyond GPT, including Claude models via the agent layer.

---

## Continue.dev

*[2026-01-30]*: Continue.dev is the leading open-source alternative—maximum flexibility at the cost of configuration effort.

### Model Freedom

Continue supports:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, o1)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Mistral
- Local LLMs via Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp
- Custom API endpoints

This prevents vendor lock-in and enables air-gapped deployments where code never leaves the developer's machine.

### Deployment Modes

**Extension Mode:** VS Code or JetBrains extension with graphical interface.

**CLI Mode:** Terminal-native with TUI (interactive) and headless modes. Headless mode enables async cloud agents, pre-commit hooks, and scripted fixes.

### Slack Integration

`@Continue` in Slack triggers agents—useful for team workflows, automated PR generation from Sentry alerts, and security vulnerability detection.

### Trade-offs

The flexibility comes with configuration overhead. Continue requires more setup than commercial alternatives and may require troubleshooting model-specific behaviors.

## JetBrains AI Assistant

*[2026-01-30]*: For developers committed to IntelliJ-based IDEs, JetBrains AI Assistant provides native integration without leaving the ecosystem.

### IDE-Aware Completions

JetBrains leverages its deep understanding of code structure—static analysis, symbol awareness, refactoring engine—to ground AI suggestions. Multi-line completions in Java (Spring Boot) and Python (FastAPI) benefit from context that pure language models cannot access.

### Junie Agent

Junie handles tasks autonomously or collaboratively:
- Explores the project
- Writes context-appropriate code
- Runs tests
- Shares results for review

Available in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm Pro, WebStorm, GoLand, PhpStorm, RubyMine, RustRover, and Android Studio.

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Connect API keys from OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenAI-compatible providers directly—no JetBrains AI subscription required for chat and agents via BYOK.

### Local LLM Support

Connect local models via Ollama, LM Studio, or other OpenAI-compatible servers for local AI chat without cloud dependency.

---

## Aider (CLI)

*[2026-01-30]*: Aider represents the terminal-native approach—no GUI, no editor, just conversation with code.

### Repository Intelligence

Aider builds a map of the entire repository, enabling refactoring and feature updates that touch many files without manually specifying each one.

### Git-Native Workflow

Describe changes in natural language; Aider edits files and creates proper git commits. Standard git tools (diff, log, reset) manage and undo AI changes—familiar version control rather than proprietary undo systems.

### Broad Model Support

Works with Claude, DeepSeek, OpenAI models, and local models via Ollama. Model-agnostic design means switching providers doesn't require learning new tools.

### Voice and Visual Input

Voice-to-code for hands-free operation. Image and web page support for providing visual context, screenshots, or reference documentation.

### Lint and Test Integration

Automatic linting and testing after each change; Aider can fix detected problems without additional prompting.

## Combining Tools

*[2026-01-30]*: Practitioners often combine tools rather than choosing one:

**Copilot + Claude via API:** Copilot handles inline completions; Claude handles complex reasoning via chat or agent mode.

**Cursor + Aider:** Cursor for interactive development; Aider for batch operations, CI integration, or terminal-only environments.

**Continue + proprietary backup:** Continue for daily work with local models; fall back to commercial API for tasks requiring frontier capabilities.

The tools are not mutually exclusive. Match the tool to the task rather than seeking a single universal solution.

## Connections

- **To [Claude Code](1-claude-code.md):** Terminal-first approach that complements IDE-based tools. Many practitioners use both: IDE for interactive work, Claude Code for autonomous tasks.
- **To [Tool Use](../5-tool-use/_index.md):** IDE integrations implement tool use patterns—file editing, terminal execution, context retrieval—in domain-specific ways.
- **To [Autonomous Loops](../6-patterns/4-autonomous-loops.md):** Agent modes in Cursor, Windsurf, and Copilot implement autonomous loop patterns with varying levels of human oversight.
- **To [Production Concerns](../7-practices/4-production-concerns.md):** Enterprise features (SOC 2, air-gapped deployment, BYOK) address production security requirements.
