# Agent Frameworks

The agent framework landscape has consolidated around four major approaches: graph-based workflows (LangGraph), role-based teams (CrewAI), conversational coordination (AutoGen/Microsoft Agent Framework), and harness-powered delegation (Claude Agent SDK). Each embodies fundamentally different philosophies about how agents should coordinate.

## Framework Comparison Matrix

| Framework | Philosophy | Best For | Learning Curve | Production Maturity |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **LangGraph** | Workflows as stateful graphs | Complex branching, conditional logic | Moderate | High (v1.0, enterprise adoption) |
| **CrewAI** | Agents as role-playing teams | Rapid prototyping, clear role separation | Low | Growing (60% Fortune 500) |
| **Microsoft Agent Framework** | Conversations between agents | Research, dynamic collaboration | Moderate-High | Transitioning (from AutoGen) |
| **Claude Agent SDK** | Tool-equipped autonomous harness | Deep tool integration, code execution | Low-Moderate | Maturing |

## LangGraph

*[2026-01-30]*: LangGraph reached v1.0 as the first stable major release in the durable agent framework space. Powering production applications at Uber, LinkedIn, Klarna, and JP Morgan.

### Core Architecture

LangGraph treats agent workflows as directed graphs with nodes (processing steps) and edges (transitions). State persists automatically across execution, enabling long-running workflows without custom database logic.

**Key v1.0 Capabilities:**
- **Durable state**: Agent execution state persists automatically
- **Built-in persistence**: Save and resume workflows at any point
- **Human-in-the-loop**: First-class API support for pausing execution for human review
- **Real-time streaming**: Token-by-token output showing agent reasoning

### Design Patterns

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Sequential | Nodes chain linearly |
| Branching | Conditional edges based on state |
| Parallel | Fan-out/gather subgraphs |
| Cyclical | Loops for iterative refinement |

### Strengths

- **Granular control**: Every state transition is explicit and debuggable
- **Performance**: Lowest latency and token usage in benchmarks due to reduced redundant context passing
- **Enterprise adoption**: Production-proven at scale with observability built in
- **LangChain integration**: Seamless transition from chains to graphs when complexity requires

### Trade-offs

- **Scaling friction**: High parallelism and distributed execution require external systems
- **Missing batteries**: Retries, fallbacks, and observability often need external tooling
- **Verbose for simple cases**: Graph definition overhead for linear workflows

### When to Use

LangGraph fits when:
- Tasks require branching, error recovery, or conditional logic
- Long-running workflows need checkpoint and resume capabilities
- Production requirements demand durable execution guarantees
- Teams need visual representation of complex workflows

LangGraph does not fit when:
- Simple linear workflows suffice
- Rapid prototyping is the priority
- Teams lack graph-based thinking experience

## CrewAI

*[2026-01-30]*: CrewAI operates as a standalone framework (independent of LangChain) with 100,000+ certified developers and adoption by 60% of Fortune 500 companies.

### Core Architecture

CrewAI organizes agents into "crews" where each agent has a defined role, backstory, and tool access. Agents collaborate on tasks through structured delegation.

**Two Primitives:**
- **Crews**: Teams of autonomous agents with specialized roles
- **Flows**: Event-driven workflows that orchestrate crews and manage state

### Design Philosophy

Role-based design mirrors human team organization:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Flow                   │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │           Crew                │  │
│  │  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐    │  │
│  │  │Researcher│  │Developer│    │  │
│  │  │  Agent  │  │  Agent  │    │  │
│  │  └─────────┘  └─────────┘    │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Strengths

- **Intuitive model**: Role-based design maps to natural team structures
- **Performance**: Executes 5.76x faster than LangGraph in certain task types
- **Standalone**: No dependency on LangChain, lighter resource demands
- **Enterprise-ready**: AWS partnership with Amazon Bedrock integration

### Trade-offs

- **Less granular control**: Role abstraction hides coordination details
- **Stochastic behavior**: Agent interactions can be unpredictable
- **Limited graph capabilities**: Complex conditional logic harder to express

### When to Use

CrewAI fits when:
- Teams have clear role separation (researcher, analyst, writer)
- Rapid prototyping is prioritized over fine-grained control
- Business users need to understand agent architecture
- Multi-agent collaboration is primary use case

CrewAI does not fit when:
- Workflows require complex branching logic
- Deterministic, reproducible behavior is critical
- Fine-grained state management is needed

## Microsoft Agent Framework (AutoGen Evolution)

*[2026-01-30]*: Microsoft merged AutoGen with Semantic Kernel into a unified Microsoft Agent Framework, targeting GA by end of Q1 2026. AutoGen enters maintenance mode—existing projects require migration planning.

### Core Architecture

The Agent Framework treats workflows as conversations between agents. Each agent can communicate with humans, tools, and other agents through natural language exchange.

**Orchestration Patterns:**
- **Sequential**: Step-by-step workflows
- **Concurrent**: Agents work in parallel
- **Group chat**: Agents brainstorm collaboratively
- **Handoff**: Responsibility transfers as context evolves
- **Magentic**: Manager agent coordinates via dynamic task ledger

### Unique Capabilities

**Request and Response**: Workflows can pause execution and wait for external input before continuing—enabling sophisticated human-in-the-loop patterns not present in AutoGen's Team abstraction.

**Enterprise Integration**: Native Azure integration, multi-language support (C#, Python, Java), production SLAs, and compliance guarantees (SOC 2, HIPAA).

### Strengths

- **Conversational flexibility**: Agents adapt roles based on context
- **Microsoft ecosystem**: Deep Azure AI Foundry integration
- **Research backing**: #1 accuracy on GAIA benchmark
- **A2A Protocol**: Agent-to-Agent interoperability across runtimes

### Trade-offs

- **Stochastic behavior**: Conversation-driven agents may loop or go off-track
- **Migration overhead**: AutoGen users must migrate to Agent Framework
- **Complexity**: Conversational dynamics harder to debug than explicit graphs
- **Azure-centric**: Full capabilities require Azure investment

### When to Use

Microsoft Agent Framework fits when:
- Azure is the target deployment environment
- Dynamic, context-dependent role assignment is valuable
- Enterprise compliance requirements exist
- Conversational multi-agent patterns match the use case

Microsoft Agent Framework does not fit when:
- Deterministic workflow behavior is required
- Teams want vendor-neutral solutions
- Simple delegation suffices over conversation

## Claude Agent SDK

*[2026-01-30]*: The Claude Agent SDK (renamed from Claude Code SDK in late 2025) provides the agent harness powering Claude Code, now available for custom agent development.

### Core Architecture

The SDK provides an agentic loop where Claude autonomously reads files, runs commands, searches the web, and edits code. Tools are first-class citizens in Claude's context window.

**Key Components:**
- **Built-in tools**: File operations, command execution, code editing
- **Custom tools via MCP**: In-process MCP servers without separate processes
- **Tool Search Tool**: Access thousands of tools without context bloat
- **Programmatic tool calling**: Invoke tools in code execution environment

### Advanced Tool Use (2026)

Three features for large-scale tool libraries:
- **Tool Search Tool**: Search over tools dynamically (85% token reduction)
- **Programmatic Tool Calling**: Reduces context window impact
- **Tool Use Examples**: Universal standard for demonstrating tool usage

Performance: Opus 4.5 accuracy improved from 79.5% to 88.1% with Tool Search enabled.

### Strengths

- **Tool-native**: Tools are the primary building blocks, not an afterthought
- **Same harness as Claude Code**: Battle-tested in production
- **Python and TypeScript**: SDK available in both languages
- **MCP ecosystem**: Access to growing tool library

### Trade-offs

- **Single-vendor**: Deep Anthropic coupling
- **Emerging patterns**: Multi-agent coordination still evolving
- **Subagent constraints**: Task tool unavailable to subagents (flat orchestration)

### When to Use

Claude Agent SDK fits when:
- Deep tool integration is the primary requirement
- Autonomous code execution and file manipulation are needed
- Anthropic models are the target
- Teams want Claude Code's proven patterns

Claude Agent SDK does not fit when:
- Multi-vendor model support is required
- Complex multi-agent coordination is primary use case
- Teams need established multi-agent patterns out of the box
