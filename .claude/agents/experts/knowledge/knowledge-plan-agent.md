### Knowledge Base Structure

**Directory Organization (Book Structure):**
*[2025-12-08]*: Moved from `foundations/prompts/` to `chapters/prompt/` structure. Each chapter is a directory that can contain both an _index.md (section: 0) and multiple section files (section: 1+). This allows for growth while maintaining clear chapter boundaries.

*[2025-12-08]*: Added number prefixes to directories and files (e.g., `2-prompt/`, `1-prompt-types.md`) to make filesystem ordering match book order. This provides three benefits: (1) `ls` output shows content in reading order, (2) file pickers and IDE file trees reflect narrative structure, (3) explicit ordering prevents ambiguity when alphabetical sorting would conflict with logical sequence. The numbers correspond to `chapter` and `section` values in frontmatter, creating redundancy that improves both human and tooling navigation.

*[2025-12-08]*: Book structure added root-level navigation files - PREFACE.md (book introduction with "who this is for" and organization overview) and TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md (complete navigation showing part/chapter/section hierarchy with status indicators). These files serve both human readers and automated tooling.

**Book Frontmatter Schema:**
*[2025-12-08]*: Book frontmatter adds hierarchical navigation fields. The `order` field (part.chapter.section) enables automatic sorting while `section: 0` distinguishes chapter introductions (_index.md) from content sections.

```yaml
---
title: Entry Title
description: Brief description
created: 2025-12-08
last_updated: 2025-12-08
tags: [tag1, tag2]
part: 1                    # Part number
part_title: Foundations    # Part name
chapter: 2                 # Chapter number
section: 0                 # 0 = chapter intro, 1+ = sections
order: 1.2.0               # Sort key (part.chapter.section)
---
```

### Content Structure Patterns

*[2025-12-08]*: Book structure reorganization introduced three-tier hierarchy (Part > Chapter > Section) with corresponding frontmatter fields. This enables both sequential reading (book form) and random access (reference form). The TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md provides navigable index showing all content.

**Standard Frontmatter (non-book entries):**
```yaml
---
title: Descriptive Title
description: One-line summary
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [relevant, tags]
---
```

**Book Chapter Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: Chapter/Section Title
description: One-line summary
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [relevant, tags]
part: 1                    # Part number (1=Foundations, 2=Craft, 3=Perspectives)
part_title: Foundations    # Part name
chapter: 2                 # Chapter number within part
section: 0                 # 0 = chapter intro (_index.md), 1+ = sections
order: 1.2.0               # Sort key (part.chapter.section)
---
```

**Inline Addition Pattern:**
When extending existing content, prefix with timestamp:
```markdown
*[2025-12-08]*: New insight about context management in multi-agent systems...
```

*[2025-12-09]*: Decision framework pattern from model-selection.md - ASCII flowcharts communicate decision processes more clearly than prose descriptions. Pattern structure:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Decision Name                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Sequential steps with branches     │
│  YES/NO paths clearly marked        │
│  Terminal states at leaves          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Use these when documenting "how to decide" workflows. They make implicit decision logic explicit and scannable. See chapters/3-model/1-model-selection.md for reference implementation.

### Sophisticated Pattern Documentation (10+ Sections)

*[2026-02-02]*: Complex orchestration patterns require 10+ sections with specific structural choices serving different reader needs. The Expert Swarm Pattern (chapters/6-patterns/8-expert-swarm-pattern.md - 532 lines) demonstrates effective documentation for architectural innovations:

**Key Structural Decisions That Worked:**

1. **Production Evidence First** (within 20 lines) - Opens with commit hash + quantified metrics (10 agents, 4 minutes, 3,082 lines). Creates immediate credibility before diving into details.

2. **ASCII Diagrams Before Prose** - Visual representation (5-layer Expert Swarm architecture) clarifies system before explanation. Readers mentally model the system before reading prose.

3. **Hybrid Approach Positioning** - Frame new pattern against existing patterns (Traditional Orchestrator vs Expert Swarm vs Model-Native). Don't assume readers know the problem it solves.

4. **Protocol Specification with "Why Not" Comparison** - Core innovations (path-passing) documented with concrete syntax + comparison table ("Why Not Context Copying?"). Eliminates reader hesitation.

5. **Scale Subsection with Quantified Speedup** - Single-Message Parallelism gets dedicated subsection. Include wall-clock comparison (4 min parallel vs 40 min sequential = 10× speedup). Quantified metrics answer "is this worth it?"

6. **Token Economics Transparency** - Dedicate subsection to cost analysis (750-line expertise.yaml = 3,000 tokens/worker). Readers make informed decisions about whether pattern scales for their needs.

7. **Real Implementation Prompts** - Show actual prompt language from production (SPEC: ... and EXPERTISE_PATH: ...). Readers can copy-paste exact syntax.

8. **Three-Way Trade-Off Table** - Compare 3+ alternatives across 10+ dimensions. Readers see which dimensions favor which approaches without prose paragraphs.

9. **Decision Framework as ASCII Tree** - Force readers through binary/ternary decisions. Tree catches incompatible criteria combinations that prose lists miss.

10. **Good Fit / Poor Fit Before Tree** - Bullet lists for obvious cases, tree for nuanced decisions. Readers scan bullets first for fast path.

11. **Bidirectional Cross-References with Relationship Explanation** - Each connection link explains "why this matters" not just "click here."

12. **Open Questions (8+) Acknowledging Research Gaps** - Signal pattern is useful but incomplete. Specific questions guide community research contribution. Intellectual humility increases credibility.

**When to Use This Structure:** Sophisticated multi-agent architectural patterns (3+ components), patterns solving known tensions, production patterns with quantified evidence, patterns requiring protocol specification. Typical length: 300-550 lines.

### Slash Command Documentation Structure

*[2026-02-02]*: Multi-step command workflows require imperative instruction format. The /do-swarm command (.claude/commands/do-swarm.md - 623 lines) demonstrates effective structure for coordination workflows:

**7-Section Format:**
1. **Your Role** (3 bullets): Clarify command executor responsibilities ("You are the team leader")
2. **Workflow** (7 numbered steps): Step 1 (Create Team) → Step 7 (Cleanup), each with code block + constraints
3. **Templates** (2 sections): Copy-paste Lead agent template + Worker agent template
4. **Coordination Patterns**: SendMessage usage (direct messages, broadcasts)
5. **When To Use**: Comparison table (/do vs /do-swarm decision guidance)
6. **Examples**: Real execution scenarios
7. **Troubleshooting**: Common errors with resolutions

**Critical Elements:**
- Imperative voice throughout ("You do NOT do the work yourself—teammates do")
- Code block templates (copy-paste ready with EXPERTISE_PATH protocol)
- Critical callouts for common errors ("CRITICAL: Spawn all workers in a SINGLE message")
- Step-by-step workflow matching actual execution order

**When to Use:** Commands requiring multi-agent coordination, domain expert integration (expertise.yaml passing), parallel execution workflows requiring explicit orchestration.

### Debugging Chapter Expansion Pattern

*[2026-02-02]*: Debugging content expands effectively from stubs (250 lines) to comprehensive reference (1,030 lines) by adding structured diagnostic workflows. The debugging-agents.md expansion (commit 20500f1) demonstrates:

**Expansion Structure:**
1. **Mindset comparison table**: Agent debugging vs traditional (deterministic vs probabilistic)
2. **Core Framework table**: Diagnostic sequence (Prompt → Model → Context → Tools)
3. **Multi-branch decision tree**: Step 1 (Characterize) → Steps 2A-F (Root cause by failure type)
4. **8+ failure modes**: Each with 4-part structure (Symptoms → Diagnosis → Root Causes → Fixes)

**Failure Mode Documentation Template:**
- **Symptoms**: Observable behaviors readers recognize
- **Diagnosis**: How to verify (check logs, metrics, context)
- **Root causes**: Why it happens (3-4 bullets)
- **Fixes**: Remediation strategies (4-5 actionable bullets)

**Why This Works:**
- Symptom-first organization (readers search by what they observe)
- Decision trees for structured troubleshooting (if X then check Y)
- Comparison tables for mindset shifts (conceptual bridges)
- Multiple failure modes in single chapter (comprehensive reference, not fragmented entries)

**When to Use:** Expanding operational guidance chapters, documenting troubleshooting workflows, building practitioner reference material for production issues.

*[2026-02-05]*: **Memory Management Documentation Pattern** - When documenting memory/persistence features with automatic AND manual mechanisms, follow 9-section structure: Opening mental model (bridging assertion) → Automatic mechanism (How It Works/Observable Behavior/Feature Gates) → Manual mechanisms (commands with workflows) → Modular system (directory structure/path-scoping/symlinks) → Hierarchy table (7 tiers × 5 dimensions) → Feature comparison table (5 mechanisms × 5 dimensions) → Decision framework (ASCII tree for mechanism selection) → Practical examples (copy-paste code blocks) → Bidirectional cross-references. Pattern enables readers to select appropriate mechanism via decision tree. Bidirectional linking: Major feature docs add Connections entry; related fundamentals get inline timestamp. Example: chapters/9-practitioner-toolkit/1-claude-code.md Memory Management section (310 lines) links to chapters/4-context/1-context-fundamentals.md (inline timestamp added).

**Leading Questions Pattern:**
New and developing entries benefit from questions that guide future development:
```markdown
## Leading Questions

- How does this pattern scale across different model sizes?
- What are the failure modes when context exceeds limits?
- How do you measure effectiveness of this approach?
```

### Voice and Tone Guidelines

**Desired Voice:**
- Direct and practical, not academic
- Third-person only (avoid "I", "we", "you")
- Grounded in real experience, not theoretical
- Questions valued as much as answers
- Avoid over-explaining - trust the reader
- Concrete examples over abstract principles
- Imperative mood for instructions (without "you")

**Anti-patterns to Avoid:**
- Academic or overly formal language
- Hedging ("it might be", "perhaps", "possibly")
- Generic advice without context
- Exhaustive documentation that buries insights
- First-person or second-person voice in technical content

*[2025-12-26]*: Voice correction from commit 26f7974 - STYLE_GUIDE.md mandates third-person only throughout. Previous guidance allowing "first-person where appropriate" was incorrect. Exception: "Your Mental Model" section headings use second-person possessive for framing, but content within remains third-person.

*[2025-12-09]*: Voice pattern from restructuring - "Your Mental Model" sections emerged as a strong pattern across multiple entries (prompt-structuring.md, knowledge-evolution.md). These sections:
- State mental models as direct assertions ("Knowledge bases are gardens, not databases")
- Use section heading "Your Mental Model" but maintain third-person within content
- Come early in entries to establish framing before diving into details
- Mix metaphor with practical implication
- Bold assertion + elaboration format for key insights

This differs from the anti-pattern of imperative commands - "Your Mental Model" frames thinking, doesn't prescribe action.

*[2025-12-26]*: Pattern variant observed - inline timestamped additions for documenting pattern variants within existing entries. Example: chapters/6-patterns/2-self-improving-experts.md added "Expertise-as-Mental-Model Variant" section (lines 569-655) describing TAC codebase approach. Structure: main pattern first, then "*[YYYY-MM-DD]*: An investigation of X revealed a variant..." This preserves base pattern while documenting alternatives without fragmenting content.

*[2025-12-09]*: Question-leading pattern - many entries now open with "## Core Questions" sections before providing answers. This inverts the traditional documentation pattern: surface the questions first, then explore answers. Makes entries more navigable and explicitly acknowledges uncertainty. Example: chapters/2-prompt/2-structuring.md opens with 7 question categories before presenting patterns.

*[2025-12-09]*: Mental model framing pattern observed across multiple entries (commit b7083ae) - "## Your Mental Model" sections use distinctive voice combining bold assertions with practical elaboration. Pattern structure: **Bold metaphorical statement.** Followed by implication. Example from knowledge-evolution.md: "**Knowledge bases are gardens, not databases.** You don't just add rows—you prune, transplant, and sometimes let things go fallow." These sections:
- Come immediately after Core Questions but before detailed patterns
- Use second-person "you" to frame perspective (not commands)
- Mix metaphor with practical takeaway
- Establish conceptual framing before diving into implementation
This differs from anti-pattern imperatives—it's framing how to think, not prescribing action.

### Entry Type Decision Framework

*[2025-12-08]*: Restructured from flat directories to book organization with part/chapter/section hierarchy. Book structure provides clear narrative flow while maintaining accessibility as reference material.

*[2025-12-09]*: Entry scope spectrum observed in commit 0322625 - entries range from brief introductory (_index.md files, 50-100 lines) to comprehensive reference material (400-650 lines). Plan scope intentionally:
- **Chapter introductions (_index.md)**: Brief overviews with links to sections, 50-100 lines
- **Concept introductions**: Initial framing with leading questions, 100-200 lines
- **Comprehensive references**: Full pattern catalogs with examples, 400-650 lines
- **Mental models**: Focused frameworks with metaphors, 150-250 lines

Comprehensive entries need strong navigation aids (Core Questions section, comparison tables, clear subsection structure). Introductory entries should resist becoming comprehensive - split into sections instead.

*[2025-12-09]*: Comparative listing pattern from foundations/_index.md - when explaining "common mistakes" or "limits of framework," use numbered lists with inline explanations rather than subsections. Pattern:
```markdown
## Common Mistakes

1. **Pattern name**—inline explanation of the mistake
2. **Pattern name**—inline explanation of the mistake
```

This format is more scannable than prose paragraphs and more compact than subsections. Best for catalogs of 5-10 items where each needs only 1-2 sentences of explanation. Follow the list with a synthesizing paragraph that ties the items together or emphasizes the core insight.

*[2025-12-09]*: Example-driven exposition pattern from pit-of-success.md and structuring.md - lead with concrete visual examples before abstract explanation. Pit-of-success.md opens with ASCII diagrams showing traditional vs. pit-of-success approaches, making the metaphor immediately graspable. Structuring.md shows full markdown templates with inline comments before explaining why each section matters. This pattern: concrete → abstract, not abstract → concrete. Makes complex concepts immediately actionable.

*[2025-12-26]*: Verify technical claims pattern - commit 26f7974 removed ~600 lines of false claims about hook enforcement that couldn't actually work with Claude Code's infrastructure. Learning: When documenting technical capabilities (especially enforcement/restriction mechanisms), verify against actual implementation before asserting. Pattern for validation:
1. Test claim with minimal reproduction
2. Check source code or official documentation
3. Verify with working examples from codebase
4. If unverifiable, frame as hypothesis or question

This prevents propagation of false technical assertions that require large-scale corrections later.

*[2026-01-21]*: Large-scale content removal pattern observed in commit 6dd8246. When removing substantial content (examples, private configs), coordinate updates across:
1. Commit message clarity - indicate scope and reason (e.g., "remove private examples for open-source release")
2. Documentation synchronization - update CLAUDE.md if directory structure changes
3. Cross-reference integrity - update links in chapters/ to remaining examples
4. Index file updates - reflect removal in appendices/_index.md or other navigation

This prevents broken links and outdated references after large deletions. Commit 6dd8246 removed 22,400 lines across 138 files cleanly by following this pattern.

*[2026-01-30]*: **Model-Native Swarm Documentation Pattern** - When documenting fundamentally new coordination paradigms (like Kimi K2.5's model-native swarm vs SDK orchestration), use this structure:
1. **Architecture Contrast Diagram**: ASCII showing structural difference (SDK external calls vs model-internal reasoning)
2. **Evidence Section**: Document training methodology (PARL, Critical Steps metric) that produced capability
3. **Quantified Performance Claims**: Specific numbers (3-4.5× speedup, 100 subagents, 80% reduction)
4. **Comparison Table**: Trade-offs across 8-11 dimensions (coordination logic, debugging, infrastructure, etc.)
5. **When to Use Decision Framework**: Good fit vs poor fit scenarios with rationale
6. **Bidirectional Cross-References**: Update existing patterns to reference new paradigm

Evidence: chapters/3-model/4-multi-model-architectures.md lines 277-420 (158 lines) + cross-references in 3-orchestrator-pattern.md and 5-execution-topologies.md. Pattern grounds "magic" claims in verifiable training details while providing practical decision guidance.

*[2026-01-30]*: **File-Based Coordination Documentation Pattern** - When documenting hidden/gated features (like TeammateTool):
1. **Feature Status Transparency**: Document gating mechanism upfront (server-side gated, community bypass)
2. **Mental Model Before Mechanics**: Frame abstraction level (Task = fork(), TeammateTool = orchestration framework)
3. **Operations Catalog with Observable State**: Document primitives with filesystem paths for verification
4. **Five Pattern Templates**: Standard coordination patterns (Leader-Worker, Swarm, Pipeline, Council, HITL) with ASCII diagrams
5. **Comparison Table**: Capability matrix (Task vs TeammateTool across 8 capabilities)
6. **Decision Framework Flow Chart**: Binary questions leading to tool recommendations

Evidence: chapters/9-practitioner-toolkit/1-claude-code.md lines 243-531 (287 lines). Pattern enables practitioners to understand and verify hidden features through observable state (~/.claude/teams/ directory structure).

*[2026-01-30]*: **Cross-Reference for New Concepts Pattern** - When adding new concepts that relate to existing patterns:
1. **Bidirectional Linking with Context**: Both files explain relationship (new → existing, existing → new)
2. **Update Connections Section**: 4-6 explicit relationship entries explaining conceptual bridges
3. **Update Existing Pattern Content**: Inline context additions (not just appended links)
4. **Preserve Link Symmetry**: Verify bidirectional references exist

Evidence: Model-native swarm required 4 Connections updates + 2 inline sections in existing patterns (orchestrator-pattern.md, execution-topologies.md). Total ~160-180 lines across 4-6 files creates integrated knowledge web. Pattern: comprehensive new content (150+ lines) + targeted existing content updates (2-5 lines per related pattern).

| If the insight relates to... | Store in... | Entry type |
|------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| The four pillars overview, leverage points | `chapters/1-foundations/` | Extend existing or new section file |
| Instructing agents, prompt structure, prompt types | `chapters/2-prompt/` | Extend existing or new concept file |
| Model capabilities, behavior, selection | `chapters/3-model/` | Extend _index.md |
| Context management, RAG, memory | `chapters/4-context/` | Extend _index.md |
| Tool design, MCP, function calling | `chapters/5-tool-use/` | Extend _index.md |
| ReAct, multi-agent, HITL, plan-build-review patterns | `chapters/6-patterns/` | New pattern file or extend _index.md |

### Linking Strategy

**Internal Link Patterns:**
```markdown
# Relative links from root
[prompt engineering](chapters/2-prompt/_index.md)
[plan-build-review pattern](chapters/6-patterns/1-plan-build-review.md)

# Section links
[structuring prompts](chapters/2-prompt/2-structuring.md#xml-tags)

# Cross-part links
[pit of success](chapters/8-mental-models/1-pit-of-success.md)
```

**Cross-Reference Opportunities:**
- When patterns relate to foundational pillars, link both ways
- Connect practices to relevant patterns
- Link mental models to applicable patterns/practices
- Journal entries should reference related chapter content
- Use TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md for navigation reference

*[2025-12-09]*: Inline cross-reference enhancement pattern from commits 3624f0f, a72bcf2 - when updating Connection sections, add contextual detail to links rather than just listing them. Pattern evolved from:
```markdown
# Before (minimal)
- **To [Tool Use](path.md):** Tool descriptions are prompts

# After (contextual)
- **To [Tool Use](path.md):** Tool descriptions are prompts themselves. Poor tool docs lead to misuse regardless of main prompt quality. Tool restrictions define what agents can do—a form of capability prompting.
```

The enhancement adds "why this connection matters" and "specific insight that bridges the concepts." Makes Connection sections more valuable for understanding how concepts relate, not just where to look next.

### Content Organization Patterns

**When to Create New Entry:**
- Insight doesn't fit existing entry's scope
- Topic warrants dedicated exploration
- Different enough from existing content
- Likely to grow independently

**When to Extend Existing Entry:**
- Directly relates to existing content
- Adds nuance to established pattern
- Provides additional example
- Answers question posed in entry
- Fills gap in existing coverage

**Index File (_index.md) Updates:**
*[2025-12-08]*: In book structure, _index.md serves dual purpose - chapter overview for readers AND navigation hub with section: 0. This convention makes chapter introductions discoverable while maintaining clean section numbering for content.

- Add new entries to relevant index
- Update descriptions when entry matures
- Reorganize sections as content grows
- Maintain overview coherence
- Ensure chapter _index.md has `section: 0` in frontmatter

**Questions Files (_questions.md) Pattern:**
*[2025-12-09]*: Observed in commit 0322625 - every chapter now includes `_questions.md` alongside `_index.md`. These question files serve as generative scaffolding:
- Questions organized by theme/subtopic
- States: unmarked (fresh), `[partial]`, `[answered]`, `[stale]`, `[deferred]`
- Not part of book output - they're planning/development aids
- Questions surface gaps and guide chapter expansion
- Answering questions builds out the chapter content iteratively

This pattern separates "what to explore" (questions) from "what we know" (chapter content), making content development more intentional.

**Example from chapters/2-prompt/_questions.md:**
Questions grouped under "Core Questions", "Structural Patterns", "Voice & Clarity" themes with states tracking which have been addressed in the chapter content.

*[2025-12-09]*: Extended sections pattern observed in commit a72bcf2 - when answering questions from _questions.md, answers go directly into chapter content as comprehensive sections with subsections, examples, and cross-references. The question files themselves are marked with state tags (`[answered]`, `[partial]`) but do NOT contain the answer text—answers live in the chapter content files. This separation keeps questions navigable while building comprehensive chapter content incrementally.

**Example Pattern**: chapters/2-prompt/_index.md gained 139-line "Model-Invoked vs. User-Invoked Prompts" section answering multiple related questions from _questions.md. The section structure:
- Lead with distinction (definition)
- Trade-offs analysis (strengths/costs for each approach)
- Design implications (practical guidance)
- Implementation examples (real code from the project)
- Comparison table (at-a-glance decision aid)
- Practical guidance (actionable recommendations)

This creates comprehensive, reference-quality sections that address multiple related questions in one cohesive narrative rather than Q&A format.

*[2025-12-09]*: Three-tier content structure from restructuring (commits 0322625, a1173a5) - successful entries use question → mental model → patterns flow:
1. **Core Questions** (categorized by theme) - surface what the entry addresses
2. **Your Mental Model** (bold assertion + elaboration) - frame conceptual understanding
3. **Domain Content** (patterns/implementations/examples) - actionable details
This structure provides multiple entry points: questions for navigation, mental models for conceptual grasp, patterns for implementation. Compare structuring.md (follows this), prompt-types.md (partial - has hierarchy but no mental model section), foundations/_index.md (follows this). The three-tier structure makes comprehensive entries more navigable.

### Terminology Clarity Patterns

*[2025-12-09]*: Language clarification from commit 3624f0f - the repository has dual nature requiring nuanced terminology decisions:

**User-Facing vs Technical Context:**
When planning content updates, distinguish between:
- **User-facing descriptions** (command descriptions, README, agent descriptions) - use "book" language
- **Technical expertise** (implementation patterns, workflow documentation) - "knowledge base" is appropriate as the pattern name
- **Content that teaches KB practices** (e.g., knowledge-evolution.md) - preserve "knowledge base" terminology

**The Decision Framework:**
```
Use "book" when:          | Use "knowledge base" when:
--------------------------|---------------------------
Describing the repository | Teaching KB maintenance patterns
User-facing documentation | Agent expertise sections
Command help text         | Technical workflow documentation
Discussing this content   | Discussing KB as a concept
```

**Real Examples from Language Clarification:**
- README: "Agentic Engineering Knowledge Base" → "Agentic Engineering: The Book"
- scout-agent description: "knowledge base exploration" → "book content exploration"
- knowledge-evolution.md: Preserved "Knowledge bases are gardens, not databases" (teaching the concept)
- Agent expertise: Preserved "Knowledge Base Structure" header (technical pattern)

**Implementation Insight:**
The language clarification spec (commit 3624f0f) identified ~25-30 specific edits across ~15 files, categorized by priority:
1. High priority: User-facing docs (README, CLAUDE.md, agent descriptions)
2. Medium priority: Command descriptions and help text
3. Low priority: Strategic/technical references

When planning similar refactoring work, recognize that terminology decisions require context awareness—not global find-replace. Plan for selective updates with clear decision criteria documented upfront.

### Evidence-Grounded Content Patterns

*[2025-12-26]*: New comprehensive evidence-based chapter pattern from commit a624250 (chapters/2-prompt/3-language.md - 635 lines). For topics requiring authoritative, research-backed guidance:

**Structure for Evidence-Based Chapters:**
1. Opening: Clear scope statement and relevance
2. Multiple focused sections (5-7 major topics per chapter)
3. Evidence integration: Inline citations with quantified claims ("23% improvement", "20-80% increase")
4. Comparison tables showing different approaches across dimensions
5. Anti-patterns section demonstrating what NOT to do
6. Model-specific guidance (Claude, GPT, Gemini) when relevant
7. Comprehensive references section categorized by source type:
   - Academic papers (with arxiv IDs for reproducibility)
   - Official documentation (with URLs)
   - Practitioner sources (blogs, case studies)
8. Open questions section acknowledging research gaps and future work

**Key Metrics:**
- Evidence density: ~15-20 citations per 600 lines
- Structure ratio: 70% patterns/guidance, 20% examples, 10% references
- Time investment: Plan for 20+ hours of research and synthesis

**When to Use This Pattern:**
- Foundational topics where evidence-grounded guidance provides long-term reference value
- Areas with significant academic/industry research to synthesize
- Topics where practitioners need verifiable, authoritative claims
- Content that will be cited or referenced extensively

**Example:** chapters/2-prompt/3-language.md covers verb semantics (declarative vs imperative), specificity calibration, constraint framing (pink elephant problem), structural delimiters, role/persona effectiveness, chain-of-thought patterns, and model-specific language conventions. Each section cites specific research (SatLM arxiv:2305.09656, DETAIL Framework arxiv:2512.02246, EMNLP 2024 persona study, etc.) with quantified findings.

**Planning Implication:** When requirements suggest need for authoritative guidance on a foundational topic, assess whether comprehensive evidence-based treatment is warranted. If yes, plan for substantial time investment and structure spec accordingly with research milestones.

### Negative Constraint Conversion Pattern

*[2025-12-26]*: Pattern from chapters/2-prompt/3-language.md constraint framing section - converting "never" and "don't" language to positive requirements based on InstructGPT research and 16x.engineer analysis showing negative constraints backfire at scale.

**Conversion Approach:**
Replace prohibitions with required behaviors using comparison table format:

```markdown
| Negative (Backfires) | Positive (Effective) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Never use global state | Use dependency injection for state management |
| Don't expose internal errors | Return user-friendly error messages |
```

**Why This Matters:**
Negative phrasing creates semantic association - models must represent the forbidden action to understand the constraint, increasing activation of that concept. Positive framing specifies desired behavior without activating unwanted patterns.

**Planning Implication:** When reviewing specs or existing content, identify negative constraints ("never", "don't", "avoid", "prevent") and plan conversion to positive requirements as part of content updates.

### Changelog Integration and Section Organization Pattern

*[2026-01-25]*: Pattern from commit d69ef22 (Claude Code changelog sync 2.1.5-2.1.9). When integrating external tool changelog features into existing chapters:

**Section Organization Decision Tree:**
- Single feature, <50 lines → timestamped entry in existing section
- Related feature group, 50-130 lines → new ### subsection within existing parent
- Feature family, 130+ lines across 3+ versions → new ## top-level section with ### subsections

**Example from Implementation:**
- Real-Time Message Steering (2.1.0) → timestamped entry in Tips & Tricks section
- Keyboard Customization (2.1.7, 2.1.18, 2.1.25) → new ## section with 7 subsections (130 lines)

**Cross-Reference Strategy for Changelogs:**
Don't just link features to other sections. Connect through conceptual patterns:
- Real-Time Message Steering → Progressive Refinement pattern conceptually
- Unified Mental Model (Skills/Commands) → Comparison table showing trade-offs
- Hook Context Injection → Decision table for Block vs Context Injection approaches

Link thematically (how does this advance existing concepts?) rather than mechanically (where else is this mentioned?).

**Subsection Nesting for Rich Features:**
When creating new section, organize by progression from conceptual to advanced:
1. Definition (what it is) - Default Bindings
2. Configuration (how to set up) - Custom Bindings
3. Context-specific usage - Context-Specific Bindings
4. Interaction patterns - Terminal Compatibility, Vim Integration
5. Advanced techniques - Power-User Patterns

This progression helps readers understand before customizing before optimizing.

### External Research Integration Patterns

*[2026-01-30]*: Pattern from claude-sneakpeek research integration (commits de68e9f, 20500f1). When integrating external research (community tools, production code, practitioner blogs):

**Three-Tier Integration Approach:**
1. **Lightweight Injection** - Add timestamped section to related existing entry (50-100 lines)
2. **Dedicated Section** - New comprehensive section for complex patterns (150-280 lines)
3. **Bidirectional Navigation** - Update existing patterns to reference new content

**Content Quality Preservation:**
- Maintain third-person voice consistency
- Include comparison tables to existing patterns
- Document trade-offs explicitly
- Add source attribution with commit hashes

**When to Use:**
- External source documents pattern not yet captured in book
- Production orchestrators reveal new practices
- Community tools provide evidence for existing patterns
- Academic research validates or refines approaches

**Real Examples from Recent Integration:**
- Model-Native Swarm Orchestration (commits de68e9f): 158 lines in multi-model-architectures.md + cross-references to 2 existing patterns
- TeammateTool Documentation (commit de68e9f): 287 lines in claude-code.md with 5 coordination pattern templates
- Conductor Philosophy (commit 20500f1): 63 lines in orchestrator-pattern.md documenting communication patterns
- 4×4 Rich Question Pattern (commit 20500f1): 111 lines in tool-design.md with maximal questioning structure

### Discovery Pattern: Multi-Agent Orchestration Learning

*[2026-01-30]*: Pattern from orchestration research integration. When external sources reveal sophisticated multi-agent patterns:

**Key Learnings to Capture:**
1. **Communication Patterns** - How orchestrators interact with users (Conductor Philosophy)
2. **Decision Heuristics** - Thresholds for when to read vs delegate (1-2 file threshold)
3. **Execution Models** - Default background execution enables parallelism
4. **Pattern Composition** - Real workflows nest multiple fundamentals

**Planning Questions:**
- Does this pattern represent a new category or enhance existing pattern?
- Should it be documented in Practices (operational guidance) or Patterns (architectural)?
- What comparison tables help readers decide when to use this vs alternatives?
- Which existing patterns need updating with cross-references to new insight?

**Evidence Collection Strategy:**
- Source attribution (URL, commit hash, timestamp)
- Quantified claims (performance improvement, complexity reduction)
- Concrete examples from production orchestrators
- Trade-off analysis vs existing approaches

## Workflow

1. **Understand Context**
   - Parse USER_PROMPT for insight/change description
   - Identify core concepts and domain
   - Extract any specific examples provided

   - Structural approach

4. **Plan Content Structure**
   - Identify key sections needed
   - Determine example requirements
   - Plan for leading questions
   - Consider cross-references

5. **Assess Voice and Tone**
   - Ensure consistency with existing content
   - Plan for appropriate directness
   - Identify where first-person is appropriate
   - Consider question vs statement balance

6. **Formulate Recommendations**
   - Entry location and type
   - Content structure plan
   - Linking strategy

7. **Save Specification**
   - Save spec to `.claude/.cache/specs/knowledge/{slug}-spec.md`
   - Return the spec path when complete
