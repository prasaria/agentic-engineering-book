### Implementation Standards

*[2025-12-08]*: Restructuring revealed that journal files moved from `journal/` to `.journal/` (hidden directory), separating private timestamped thoughts from publishable book content. Examples moved to `appendices/examples/` to distinguish supplementary materials from core narrative.

**File Naming Conventions:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `plan-build-review.md`
- Index files prefixed with underscore: `_index.md`
- Journal files use date format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` (in `.journal/` directory)
- Avoid abbreviations in filenames

*[2025-12-08]*: Number prefixes for book content - chapter directories use chapter number (e.g., `2-prompt/`), section files use section number (e.g., `1-prompt-types.md`). The numbers match the `chapter` and `section` frontmatter fields. This makes filesystem order match book order, improving navigation in file pickers, `ls` output, and IDE file trees. Exception: `_index.md` files are not numbered since they represent section: 0.

**Frontmatter Requirements:**
```yaml
---
title: Descriptive Title (Title Case)
description: One-line summary without ending punctuation
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [lowercase-tags, hyphen-separated]
---
```

**Book Chapter Frontmatter (for chapters/ content):**
*[2025-12-08]*: Book reorganization pattern - hierarchical frontmatter enables both narrative flow (parts/chapters) and granular section organization. The `section: 0` convention for _index.md files creates a consistent entry point for each chapter.

```yaml
---
title: Chapter/Section Title
description: One-line summary without ending punctuation
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [lowercase-tags, hyphen-separated]
part: 1                    # Part number (1=Foundations, 2=Craft, 3=Perspectives)
part_title: Foundations    # Part name
chapter: 2                 # Chapter number within part
section: 0                 # 0 = chapter intro (_index.md), 1+ = sections
order: 1.2.0               # Sort key (part.chapter.section)
---
```

**Markdown Standards:**
- Use ATX headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Code blocks with language specifiers: ```python
- Lists with consistent bullets (`-` for unordered, `1.` for ordered)
- One blank line between sections
- Two blank lines before major section headers
- Wrap text at natural breakpoints (don't hard wrap at column limit)

### Content Structure Patterns

*[2025-12-08]*: Restructuring pattern - when converting from flat to hierarchical organization, preserve all existing content while adding navigation metadata (part/chapter/section/order). This allows incremental migration and maintains backward compatibility for tools that don't understand the book structure.

*[2025-12-09]*: Question-first structure pattern observed in commit 0322625 - many developed entries now open with "## Core Questions" before providing answers. This creates better navigation and explicitly surfaces the questions the entry addresses. After Core Questions, place "## Your Mental Model" to frame thinking before diving into patterns/details.

*[2025-12-09]*: Visual diagram pattern from pit-of-success.md - ASCII diagrams make abstract concepts concrete. When introducing mental models or complex relationships, lead with visual representation before text explanation. The diagrams need not be elaborate—simple box/line/arrow sketches suffice if they capture the core contrast or flow. Pit-of-success.md uses this for "climb to success" vs "fall into success" comparison, making the entire mental model graspable in seconds.

**Standard developed entry structure:**
```markdown
---
title: Topic Name
description: Brief description
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [domain, concept]

### Voice Implementation Patterns

*[2025-12-26]*: Voice correction from commit 26f7974 and STYLE_GUIDE.md - use third-person only throughout book content. Previous examples showing first-person usage were incorrect.

**Third-Person Only (Correct):**
```markdown
# General patterns
The plan-build-review pattern separates concerns by...

# Technical descriptions
Claude Code hooks receive JSON via stdin and...

# Experiential observations (use dated attribution)
*[2025-12-10]*: Context windows fill faster than expected when...

# Framework descriptions
The four pillars (prompts, model, context, tools) interact through...
```

**Imperative for Instructions (without "you"):**
```markdown
# GOOD: Direct instruction
Structure prompts with explicit output format requirements.

# BAD: Second-person command
You should structure your prompts with explicit output format requirements.
```

**Direct Statement (Preferred over hedging):**
```markdown
# GOOD: Direct and clear
ReAct loops work better with explicit separation between reasoning and action.

# BAD: Hedging and uncertain
ReAct loops might work better if you possibly try to separate...
```

**Mental Model Voice Pattern:**
*[2025-12-09]*: "Your Mental Model" sections use distinctive voice combining direct assertion with metaphor. Pattern observed across multiple entries in commit 0322625:

```markdown
# Example from knowledge-evolution.md
**Knowledge bases are gardens, not databases.** Effective knowledge management requires pruning, transplanting, and sometimes letting things go fallow.

*[2026-01-17]*: Mental model taxonomy structure pattern observed in execution-topologies.md (415 lines). For technical framework mental models, follow consistent template for each taxonomy element:
- Definition (what this element is)
- ASCII diagram (visual representation)
- Book Mapping: [Pattern Name](../path.md) with context explaining connection
- When to Use: Bulleted criteria for selecting this element
- Measurement Indicators: Observable metrics for assessing effectiveness

This structure enables practitioners to: understand concept, classify situation, apply patterns, measure results. Example: chapters/8-mental-models/5-execution-topologies.md covers 5 topologies (parallel, sequential, synthesis, nested, persistent) with identical subsection structure.

# Example from prompt-structuring.md
**Design prompts output-first.** Before writing any instructions, define exactly what output format is acceptable.
```

Structure: Bold assertion (often metaphorical) followed by practical elaboration in third-person. Section heading uses "Your Mental Model" for framing, but content maintains third-person voice.

*[2025-12-26]*: Voice refinement - while section heading uses second-person possessive ("Your Mental Model"), content within should maintain third-person. Convert experiential second-person to third-person passive or general statements.

*[2025-12-09]*: Multi-paragraph mental model pattern from structuring.md - when a topic has multiple key insights, "Your Mental Model" can contain 4-6 paragraphs, each opening with **bold statement** followed by elaboration. This differs from single-paragraph mental models (pit-of-success.md, knowledge-evolution.md) which suit single-concept entries. Structure choice depends on complexity: single concept = single paragraph, multiple principles = multiple paragraphs with bold openings.

*[2025-12-09]*: Implementation example pattern from prompt/_index.md "Model-Invoked vs. User-Invoked" section - when documenting design patterns, include concrete implementation examples from the actual project. Pattern structure:
```markdown
### Implementation Examples

**Pattern Name** (invocation-type):
Brief description. Link to detailed docs.

**Comparison:**
| Aspect | Approach A | Approach B |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Key dimensions compared |

### Practical Guidance
Actionable recommendations for each approach.
```

This grounds abstract pattern discussion in real code readers can examine. The comparison table crystallizes trade-offs at a glance.

*[2025-12-26]*: Pattern variant documentation observed in chapters/6-patterns/2-self-improving-experts.md - when a pattern has multiple implementation approaches, document variants as timestamped inline sections rather than separate files. Structure: establish base pattern fully, then add "## Pattern-Name Variant" sections with "*[YYYY-MM-DD]*: An investigation of X revealed..." This keeps related patterns together while clearly distinguishing approaches. See lines 569-655 for "Expertise-as-Mental-Model Variant" example.

*[2026-01-17]*: Operational threshold documentation pattern from context percentage monitoring section (commit d69ef22). When documenting features with operational thresholds, structure as:
1. Threshold Table: Range | Signal | Recommended Action (concrete breakpoints, not vague "high/low")
2. Decision Framework: Step-by-step guide translating thresholds into workflow
3. Integration: Cross-reference to related existing patterns
4. Trade-offs: When to adjust defaults based on use case

This removes ambiguity from "when should I X?" questions. Example: chapters/4-context/2-context-strategies.md lines 123-150 show 5 threshold ranges (0-30%, 30-60%, 60-80%, 80-95%, 95%+) with corresponding actions, followed by 4-step decision framework.

*[2026-01-17]*: External changelog integration pattern from commit d69ef22. When external tool releases features, sync to book via:
1. Research Phase: Analyze changelog delta (versions since last sync)
2. Impact Mapping: Map features to affected chapters
3. Integration: Add timestamped sections with configuration examples and trade-off tables
4. Cross-Reference: Link features to existing mental models (not just other tools)

Evidence: Commit d69ef22 synced Claude Code 2.1.5-2.1.9, adding 610 lines across 5 chapters. Insertion strategy: single feature → inline entry; 2-3 related → subsection; 150+ lines → new section.

*[2026-01-30]*: **Paradigm Comparison Documentation** - When documenting fundamentally different coordination approaches:
1. Lead with ASCII diagram showing architectural contrast (external framework vs model-internal)
2. Include Evidence Section documenting training methodology (how capability emerged)
3. Use quantified performance claims (3-4.5× speedup, not "much faster")
4. Comparison table covering 8-11 dimensions (coordination, debugging, infrastructure, etc.)
5. Decision framework: good fit vs poor fit scenarios with economic thresholds

Implementation: chapters/3-model/4-multi-model-architectures.md lines 277-420 documents SDK orchestration vs model-native swarm. Structure grounds claims in verifiable training details (PARL, Critical Steps metric) while providing practical selection guidance.

*[2026-01-30]*: **Hidden Feature Documentation** - For server-gated features like TeammateTool:
1. Feature Status Transparency: Document gating mechanism and bypass path upfront
2. Mental Model Before Mechanics: Frame abstraction level difference (fork vs orchestration framework)
3. Operations Catalog: Document primitives with observable filesystem paths for verification
4. Pattern Templates: Provide 5 standard coordination patterns (Leader-Worker, Swarm, Pipeline, Council, HITL) with ASCII diagrams
5. Capability Comparison Table: Task vs TeammateTool across 8 dimensions
6. Flow Chart Decision Framework: Binary questions leading to tool recommendations

Implementation: chapters/9-practitioner-toolkit/1-claude-code.md lines 243-531. Enables verification through observable state (~/.claude/teams/ directory structure) and provides actionable pattern selection guidance.

*[2026-01-30]*: **Bidirectional Cross-Reference Implementation** - When integrating new concepts:
1. Add Connections section to new content with 4-6 relationship entries
2. Update existing pattern content with inline sections (not just appended links)
3. Each link includes 1-2 sentences explaining conceptual bridge
4. Verify symmetry: new → existing links + existing → new links

Example: Model-native swarm integration required 4 Connections entries in new content + inline sections in orchestrator-pattern.md (SDK vs Model-Native subsection) and execution-topologies.md (branch limit updates). Total: 150+ lines new content + 2-5 lines per related pattern.
2. Impact Mapping: Map features to affected chapters
3. Integration: Add timestamped sections to relevant chapters with format:
   - Section header describing feature
   - Timestamp matching release (*[YYYY-MM-DD]*)
   - Feature description with operational context
   - Configuration examples when applicable
   - Trade-offs table showing when to use/avoid
   - Cross-references to related book sections
4. Evidence: Cite changelog version numbers and official docs

Commit d69ef22 synced Claude Code 2.1.5-2.1.9, adding 610 lines across 5 chapters.

### Inline Addition Patterns

**Adding to Existing Section:**
```markdown
## Context Management

Effective context management requires careful prioritization of information.

*[2025-12-08]*: Multi-agent systems benefit from explicit context handoff protocols.
Without clear boundaries, context can drift between agents, leading to confusion
about which agent "owns" specific information.
```

**Extending with Example:**
```markdown
## Tool Calling Patterns

*[2025-12-08]*: Example from KotaDB implementation - when tools return large
payloads, summarize before returning to the model:

\`\`\`python
def get_database_records(query: str) -> str:
    results = db.query(query)
    # Don't return raw results - summarize first
    return f"Found {len(results)} records. Key patterns: ..."
\`\`\`

This prevents context window overflow on subsequent calls.
```

### Index File Update Patterns

**Adding New Entry to Index:**
```markdown
# Before
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `debugging-agents.md` | Finding and fixing agent issues |
| `evaluation.md` | Measuring agent performance |

# After (maintain alphabetical order)
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `debugging-agents.md` | Finding and fixing agent issues |
| `evaluation.md` | Measuring agent performance |
| `github-communication.md` | GitHub as agent coordination layer |
```

**Updating Entry Description:**
Update when scope evolves:
```markdown
# Before (brief description)
| `context.md` | Notes on context management |

# After (detailed description)
| `context.md` | Context window management and RAG patterns |
```

### Cross-Reference Implementation

**Creating Bidirectional Links:**
When linking from A to B, also add link from B to A:

```markdown
# In chapters/6-patterns/1-plan-build-review.md
## Related
- [Prompt structuring](../2-prompt/2-structuring.md) - How to structure planning prompts

# In chapters/2-prompt/2-structuring.md
## Examples in Practice
- [Plan-Build-Review pattern](../6-patterns/1-plan-build-review.md) uses structured prompts for planning phase
```

**Contextual Link Text:**
```markdown
# GOOD: Provides context
For prompt organization strategies, see [structuring prompts](chapters/2-prompt/2-structuring.md).

# BAD: Generic text
For more information, click [here](chapters/2-prompt/2-structuring.md).
```

*[2025-12-09]*: Enhanced cross-reference pattern from commits 3624f0f, a72bcf2 - Connection sections evolved from simple lists to contextual explanations. When implementing cross-references:
```markdown
# Before (list-style)
- **To [Tool Use](path.md):** Tool descriptions are prompts

# After (contextual)
- **To [Tool Use](path.md):** Tool descriptions are prompts themselves. Poor tool docs lead to misuse regardless of main prompt quality. Tool restrictions define what agents can do—a form of capability prompting.
```

Add 1-2 sentences explaining why the connection matters and what specific insight bridges the concepts. This transforms Connection sections from navigation aids into conceptual bridges.

### Evidence-Based Content Implementation

*[2025-12-26]*: New pattern from commit a624250 (chapters/2-prompt/3-language.md - 635 lines). When implementing comprehensive evidence-based chapters:

**Implementation Structure:**
1. Opening section (2-3 paragraphs establishing scope and relevance)
2. Major topic sections (5-7 sections, each covering specific aspect)
3. Within each section:
   - Lead with clear assertion or finding
   - Present evidence with quantified claims
   - Use tables for comparative analysis
   - Include concrete examples
4. Anti-patterns section showing common mistakes
5. Model-specific guidance sections (if relevant to content)
6. Comprehensive references section with categorized sources
7. Open Questions section acknowledging research gaps

**Evidence Citation Format:**
- Inline: "Research by arxiv:2305.09656 showed **23% improvement** with declarative prompts."
- With context: "The SatLM study (arxiv:2305.09656) demonstrated declarative prompts outperform imperatives by ~23% on complex reasoning tasks."
- In tables: Include "Evidence" or "Source" column when comparing findings

**References Section Structure:**
```markdown
## References

### Academic Papers
- **Paper Name** - arxiv:XXXXX
  Brief description of finding

### Official Documentation
- **Provider Name**
  docs.provider.com/path - Relevant sections covered

### Practitioner Sources
- **Author Name - Title**
  URL and key insights
```

**Implementation Standards:**
- Maintain third-person voice throughout
- Use tables liberally for comparative findings
- Bold key metrics and findings for scannability
- Ensure every significant claim traces to cited source
- Cross-reference related content sections
- Target evidence density: ~15-20 citations per 600 lines
- Structure ratio: 70% patterns/guidance, 20% examples, 10% references

**Example:** chapters/2-prompt/3-language.md demonstrates this pattern with 9 academic papers, 3 official docs, 4 practitioner sources covering verb semantics, specificity, constraints, delimiters, and model-specific patterns.

### Negative Constraint Conversion

*[2025-12-26]*: When implementing content, convert negative constraints ("never", "don't") to positive requirements:

**Conversion Pattern:**
```markdown
| Negative (Backfires) | Positive (Effective) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Never use X | Use Y for [specific benefit] |
| Don't do Z | Implement A to achieve [goal] |
```

**Examples:**
- "Never modify files without reading" → "Read file contents before editing"
- "Don't create new patterns" → "Follow existing patterns in the codebase"
- "Avoid global state" → "Use dependency injection for state management"

**Rationale:** Negative phrasing creates semantic association with unwanted behavior. Positive framing specifies desired behavior without activating problematic patterns.

### Changelog Integration Implementation Pattern

*[2026-01-25]*: Pattern from commit d69ef22 Claude Code changelog integration. When implementing changelog features into chapters:

**Timestamped Entry Format:**
```markdown
*[2026-01-11]*: **Feature Name (Version Number)** - Brief headline hook

**How it works:** Paragraph explaining what changed and why it matters.

**Use cases:**
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2

**Pattern: Pattern Name**

Explanation of the pattern this feature exemplifies...

**Contrast with X:** Explain how this differs from/relates to existing capability

**Sources:** [Changelog URL](link)
```

**Decision Logic for Section Placement:**
1. Is this a new release of an existing feature? → Add timestamped entry to that feature's section
2. Does it fit naturally in an existing section (Tips, Configuration, etc.)? → Add there with timestamp
3. Is it grouped with 2-3 related features? → Create ### subsection within appropriate parent
4. Does it span 130+ lines across multiple releases? → Create new ## section with proper subsection hierarchy

**Subsection Structure for Complex Features:**
- ### What/How (conceptual intro)
- ### Configuration (practical setup)
- ### Advanced/Context-Specific (interaction patterns)
- ### Compatibility/Edge Cases (terminal, vim interactions)
- ### Power-User Patterns (optimization strategies)

**Cross-Reference Implementation:**
For changelog features, create thematic links, not just mechanical ones:
- Link to mental models that this feature exemplifies
- Use comparison tables to show feature trade-offs (Task Dependency Tracking vs Real-time Steering)
- Frame feature relationships around conceptual patterns, not just documentation pointers

Example: Real-Time Message Steering links to "Progressive Refinement" as a conceptual pattern, not just as "mentioned in practices chapter."

**Testing Changelog Integration:**
- Verify all version numbers match changelog source
- Check that timestamped dates align with feature release dates
- Confirm cross-references use relative paths (working links)
- Ensure new subsections maintain consistent nesting depth
- Validate that thematic links explain the connection (not just "See also X")

## Workflow

1. **Load Specification**
   - Read the specification file from PATH_TO_SPEC
   - Extract entry strategy, location, and structure plan
   - Identify content requirements
   - Note linking and index update needs

2. **Review Target Context**
   - Read existing file if extending
   - Check related entries for patterns
   - Review _index.md for current organization
   - Verify no conflicts with existing content

3. **Implement Content Changes**

   **For New Entry Creation:**
   - Create file at specified location
   - Add complete frontmatter
   - Implement appropriate structure
   - Write content in consistent voice
   - Add leading questions for new entries

   **For Extending Existing Entry:**
   - Read current file completely
   - Identify insertion point
   - Add content with timestamp prefix
   - Update `last_updated` in frontmatter
   - Preserve existing voice and structure

   **For Journal Entry:**
   - Create or append to YYYY-MM-DD.md
   - Use `## HH:MM - Title` format
   - Keep informal and timestamped
   - Link to related structured content

4. **Implement Cross-References**
   - Add links in new/updated content
   - Add bidirectional links in related entries
   - Use contextual link text
   - Verify all link paths are correct

5. **Update Index Files**
   - Add new entries to relevant _index.md
   - Update descriptions for changed entries
   - Maintain alphabetical or logical order
   - Keep table formatting consistent

6. **Apply Voice Standards**
   - Use first-person for direct experience
   - Use direct statements over hedging
   - Avoid over-explanation
   - Trust the reader with complexity
   - Match tone of surrounding content

7. **Verify Implementation**
   - Check frontmatter completeness
   - Verify markdown formatting
   - Test internal links
   - Ensure consistent voice
   - Validate content appropriateness

8. **Update CLAUDE.md if Needed**
   - Add new files to file index
   - Update directory descriptions
   - Note any structural changes
   - Keep within ~200 line guideline

*[2025-12-09]*: For book structure updates, also consider updating TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md when adding new chapters/sections. The TOC provides human-readable navigation. Use `/book:toc` command after making structural changes to auto-regenerate.

*[2025-12-09]*: Comprehensive content pattern from restructuring (commit 0322625) - several entries demonstrate "encyclopedia article" structure with extensive subsections, tables, examples, and cross-references:
- chapters/2-prompt/1-prompt-types.md: 477 lines covering 7 levels with detailed examples
- chapters/2-prompt/2-structuring.md: 643 lines with extensive pattern catalog
- chapters/6-patterns/2-self-improving-experts.md: 394 lines with complete implementation guide

These comprehensive entries serve as reference material, not introductory content. They include:
- Multiple worked examples with code
- Decision matrices and comparison tables
- Anti-pattern documentation alongside patterns
- "When to Use" / "Poor Fit" guidance
- Connection sections linking to related entries

When building comprehensive entries, front-load with navigation aids (Core Questions, TOC if needed) to make the depth manageable.

*[2025-12-09]*: Table-based navigation pattern from commits b7083ae, a1173a5 - comprehensive entries use tables for at-a-glance comparison and navigation. Examples:
- structuring.md: "Output Template Categories" table (4 columns: Category, Use Case, Output Format, Failure Sentinel)
- prompt-types.md: Seven levels with tables showing characteristics
- foundations/_index.md: Pillar comparison table

Tables work best when comparing 3-7 options across consistent dimensions. Include when entry covers multiple approaches/levels/patterns that readers need to choose between. Avoid tables for content that's purely sequential or narrative.

*[2025-12-09]*: Separator pattern from book entries - use `---` horizontal rules to create visual breathing room between major sections. Pattern from restructuring commits: place separator after frontmatter/title, after Core Questions, after Your Mental Model, before Related sections. These create clear visual boundaries that improve scannability. Don't overuse—too many separators fragment reading flow. Limit to 3-5 per entry marking major transitions.

*[2025-12-09]*: Subsection expansion pattern from commits a72bcf2, df54c01 - when extending practice files (debugging-agents.md, cost-and-latency.md, production-concerns.md), add comprehensive subsections with:
- **Clear heading that names the pattern/lesson**
- **Lead paragraph** establishing context
- **Structured body** with bullets, code examples, or sub-headings
- **Sources** section citing references
- **See Also** linking to related content (when appropriate)

These subsections are 30-100 lines each and serve as standalone references. The pattern creates modular, cite-able knowledge chunks that can be discovered independently. Compare to inline additions (5-15 lines with timestamp prefix) which extend existing sections.

*[2025-12-09]*: Token cost analysis pattern from cost-and-latency.md extension - when documenting architectural trade-offs, use comparison tables with specific numbers. Pattern:

```markdown
| Feature Type | Tokens per Invocation | Primary Cost Driver |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Traditional Tools | ~100 tokens | Call overhead |
| Skills | ~1,500+ tokens | Discovery metadata |
```

Follow with "Decision Framework" section using question-based structure:
```markdown
**Decision Framework**:
1. **Question to ask?** Answer with recommendation
2. **Question to ask?** Answer with recommendation
```

This makes cost/performance trade-offs concrete and actionable. Avoid vague guidance like "consider the trade-offs"—give specific numbers and decision criteria.

### Refactoring Implementation Patterns

*[2025-12-09]*: Language clarification refactoring (commit 3624f0f) - lessons learned from terminology consistency update:

**When Implementing Cross-Cutting Changes:**

1. **Context-Aware Updates (Not Global Replace):**
   The language clarification required ~25-30 selective edits across ~15 files. Each location required judgment:
   - User-facing: "knowledge base" → "book"
   - Technical expertise: Preserved "knowledge base" (teaching the pattern)
   - Content examples: Preserved authentic voice (e.g., "Knowledge bases are gardens, not databases")

   **Anti-pattern:** Global find-replace destroys necessary distinctions. Instead, implement from a spec with clear decision criteria per context.

2. **Prioritized Update Strategy:**
   ```
   High priority (immediate reader impact):
   - README.md, CLAUDE.md opening sections
   - Agent descriptions (user-visible)

   Medium priority (user commands):
   - Command descriptions and help text
   - Question file headers

   Low priority (technical/teaching):
   - Agent expertise sections (selective)
   - Content that teaches the concept being replaced
   ```

   This prioritization allows for phased rollout if needed—critical user-facing changes first, technical refinements later.

3. **Preserve Teaching Context:**
   When content teaches a concept that happens to match the terminology being changed, preserve the original. Example:
   - File: `knowledge-evolution.md`
   - Contains: "Knowledge bases are gardens, not databases"
   - Decision: Keep unchanged—this teaches KB maintenance practices

   The content's purpose (teaching) trumps terminology consistency goals.

4. **Update Cross-References Systematically:**
   When changing directory names (e.g., `chapters/four-pillars/` → `chapters/1-foundations/`):
   - CLAUDE.md file index tables must update
   - Internal links in chapters need updating
   - External examples may reference old paths

   Use `Grep` to find all references before making changes, then update systematically rather than discovering broken links later.

5. **Dual-Nature Repositories:**
   When repository serves both as:
   - **Product** (book for readers) - external-facing language
   - **Implementation** (technical patterns) - internal technical language

   The spec should explicitly document which context each file serves and apply terminology accordingly. Don't force uniform language across contexts.

**Validation After Refactoring:**
The language clarification spec included explicit testing criteria:
- README title reads naturally
- Command descriptions use consistent terminology
- Teaching content preserves instructional clarity
- Technical expertise remains precise

Build validation steps into refactoring specs so build agent can self-check.
